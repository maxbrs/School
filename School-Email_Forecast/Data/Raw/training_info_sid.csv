March 3, 2011Re: Syria aiding Qaddafi
This memo has two parts. Part one is the report that Syria is providing air support for Qaddafi. Part two is a note
to Cody from Lord David Owen, former UK foreign secretary on his views of an increasingly complex crisis. It
seems that the situation is developing into a protracted civil war with various nations backing opposing sides
with unforeseen consequences. Under these circumstances the crucial challenge is to deprive Qaddafi of his
strategic depth—his support both financial and military.
I. Report
During the afternoon of March 3, advisers to Muammar Qaddafi stated privately that the Libyan
Leader has decided that civil war is inevitable, pitting troops and mercenary troops loyal to him
against the rebel forces gathering around Benghazi. Qaddafi is convinced that these rebels are
being supported by the United States, Western Europe and Israel. On March 2 Qaddafi told his
son Saif al-Islam that he believes the intelligence services of the United States, Great Britain,Cody,
Realistically the UN will not authorise a no fly zone while Gaddafi continues to hold off bombing and
strafing but keeping it up front and on the military agenda keeps him worried. Yet for a few frustrating months
that ambivalence kept the Serbian aeroplanes on the ground before we acted. My hope is that preparations
continue with visuals of planes flying off carriers, airborne early warning planes flying and people with clout
outside the Administration demanding preparations. But and it is a big BUT what else can and should we be
doing? Encourage humanitarian ships and convoys from Egypt to bring in supplies since we must ensure the
cities in the East can hold up living standards, maybe for months. More adventurous, Egyptian Special Forces to
go in and advise, even supplying hand held missiles. It appears they have few missiles; the military in the East
having been deliberately kept ill-equipped. There is old Nasserite sentiment for a Federation of Egypt, Sudan
and Libya. I know some will say Egypt has enough problems and they should stay resolutely focused on
domestic reforms. it is delicate but words alone and the balance of advantage will slip to Gaddafi. A Gaddafi",huma.abedin@univ-tlse3.fr

Please find below a status report on Chris Stevens mission to Benghazi.
Thanks.
TimStatus update on the Chris Stevens mission to Benghazi:
The current game plan is for Mr. Stevens to move no later than Wednesday from Malta to Benghazi. He will stage off
shore initially for a one day visit during which he will have meetings with TNC interlocutors and get a sense of the
situation on the ground. The goal of this one day trip is for him to lay the groundwork for a stay of up to 30 days.
He will be accompanied by a DS team, a staff member from Embassy Tripoli and the leader of USAID's DART team. With
the support of Ambassador Cretz and Embassy Tripoli, Mr Stevens is in contact with TNC members on the ground in
Benghazi and elsewhere; the team is also in contact with other diplomatic missions and NGOs in Benghazi. We expect to
get support in particular from the Turks who have a consulate in Benghazi.
Mr. Stevens team has been in touch with Africom planners on the details of the mission. We have made the official
request for support from OSD but have yet to get approval. Once we have that — and we hope that will be very soon --
we will be able to move forward with the planning.

According to Politico yesterday, there was an internal argument within the Romney campaign over
Libya. Obviously, the neocons and the Rove oriented faction (Ed Gillespie, Rove's surrogate is now a
Romney campaign adviser) beat Stuart Stevens.
Romney is careening from tactic to tactic, hoping something will catch.
I wouldn't be surprised to see Romney raise the specter of the Muslim Brotherhood in charge of Egypt

Libya's Rebels
Pm Just Speaking For Myself, Former President Says
By SUZAN CLARICE
April 3, 2011 —
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton said he thinks the United States should consider arming the rebels in Libya's
civil war.
""It would depend ... and I might need to know a little more, but I would be inclined to do it,"" Clinton told
correspondent Bianna Golodryga today in San Diego during an exclusive interview with ABC News.
Clinton was in San Diego for his annual Clinton Global Initiative University Meeting.
The uprising in Libya stared in February during a wave of social and political unrest in the Middle East.
Fighting has escalated all across the country, but the rebels have found themselves outgunned by Libyan leader
Col. Moamrnar Gadhafi's forces, which are better equipped.
Last month the United Nations authorized a no-fly zone over the North African nation to prevent further attacks
on civilians from Gadhafiss troops in the air.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

,There is probably no greater Islamic authority for sunni muslims than him (there are actually a few of them, but he's the
oldest). And they don't do this often.
,RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Ara.bia's Grand Mufti, the highest religious authority in the birthplace of Islam, on
Saturday denounced attacks on diplomats and embassies as un-Islamic after deadly protests against a U.S.-made
film mocking Islam's founder.
Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Abdullah Al al-Sheikh also called on governments and international bodies to
criminalise insults against prophets and excoriated the film that has prompted a wave of fury across the Middle
East.
""It is forbidden to punish the innocent for the wicked crimes of the guilty, or to attack those who have been
granted protection of their lives and property, or to expose public buildings to fire or destruction,"" he said in a
speech carried by state news agency SPA.
Describing the release of the crudely made short film as ""miserable"" and ""criminal"", he added that attacks on
the innocent and diplomats ""are also a distortion of the Islamic religion and are not accepted by God"".
At least nine people were killed after noon prayers on Friday in demonstrations across the Middle East.

The father of Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya who was killed in the attack in Benghazi last month, said
his son's death shouldn't be politicized in the presidential campaign.
""it would really be abhorrent to make this into a campaign issue,"" Jan Stevens, 77, said in a telephone interview from his
home in Loomis, California, as he prepares for a memorial service for his son next week.
Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, has criticized President Barack Obama for not providing adequate security in
Libya, saying the administration has left the country exposed to a deadly terrorist attack.
The ambassador's father, a lawyer, said politicians should await the findings of a formal investigation before making
accusations or judgments.
""The security matters are being adequately investigated,"" Stevens said. ""We don't pretend to be experts in security. It
has to be objectively examined. That's where it belongs. It does not belong in the campaign arena."" Stevens said he has
been getting briefings from the State Department on the progress of the investigation.
'Very Optimistic'
Stevens said while he was close with his son, ""we weren't that familiar with the day-to-day activities' he undertook in
Libya. On the occasions when his son called home, Stevens said, he didn't share many details about his work other than
to say that ""he was very optimistic about the results of the election and the new government."" They last spoke by phone

with the government of the United Kingdom (UK) in an effort to obtain their support in reaching a ceasefire

150,2012-09-17T04:00:00+00:00,"BENGHAZI (Reuters) - An amateur video appears to show Libyans trying to rescue U.S. ambassador
Christopher Stevens from a room filled with smoke at the U.S. mission where he was found unconscious after
last week's attack by a mob protesting against a film that denigrates the Prophet Mohammad.
The video,, which appeared on the interne and a copy of which was obtained by Reuters in Benghazi,
confirms reports that suggested the U.S. envoy died of asphyxiation after the building caught fire.
The footage also sheds new light on the circumstances of the ambassador's death, apparently showing for the
first time that some of the people who forced their way into the U.S. compound later tried to rescue Stevens
after they found him lying alone, with no security detail, in one of the rooms in the building.
The video shows a group of young men who had earlier stormed the compound telling other protesters by the
light of torches and mobile phones that they had found someone who appeared to be a foreigner lying on the
floor.
""There is someone inside He is a foreigner, he is a foreigner. Take him out,"" said one man, shouting for
help.
""Bring him out, man! Bring him out,"" another said.
""The man is alive. Bring him out, man. Bring him out,"" said a third.
""Alive, Alive! God is Greatest,"" the crowd cried. Someone called for a car.
""Make space, is there someone who is a medic around? Anyone who can get a car quickly?"" another man can
be heard saying.
Stevens and three other embassy staff died when gunmen attacked the U.S. consulate and a safe house in the
eastern Libyan city on Tuesday night. The attackers were part of a crowd blaming America for a film they said
insulted the Prophet Mohammad.
Security personnel were separated from Stevens during the attack, U.S. officials said, in the chaos of smoke
and gunfire that ensued.
The identity and motive of the attackers remain unclear. Activists who took part in the protest said the
motive was rage at the video produced in California and which describes the Prophet as a homosexual and",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

By any standard of reason, President Obama and Secretary of State Canton conducted themselves very well amid the
confusion and crises Of course they didn't do everything perfectly; for example, some unidentified administration official
disowned the embassy statement condemning the video. Such creepiness served only to make it look like Obama was
running for cover at the expense of our embattled diplomats. But minor miscues aside, Obama and Clinton nailed the
main points, especially Clinton. In her first statement soon after the riots, here s what she said The United States
deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back
to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.""",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

traveled with me. It was extremely productive. SG Rasmussen chaired a meeting on 1325 today of all the NATO member
and partner ambassadors incl DaIcier. The new NATO special rep for 1325 -- the position sponsored by Norway and
approved at the Chicago summit — gave her inaugural address, and my DOD colleague and I discussed the US efforts
both generally and in Afghanistan. We were followed by extensive remarks from the NATO ambassadors, all of whom
touched on the importance of women's role in security and NATO's mission, as well as applauded US leadership. Many
mentioned you in their interventions! The ambs from Serbia, Azerbaijan and Georgia pointed to their own national
action plans (their existence was a surprise to us), as well as the new structures they have put in place to implement
them. The ambassador from Azerbaijan even said that he is hopeful women will contribute to ending their regional
conflict (I will tell Morningstar). The new special rep - a seasoned diplomat who knows her way around NATO --- wanted
me to ten you how much you have inspired her -- something I hear everywhere!
I'm confident our NATO visit also served to reinforce the importance of the NAP and the US role with our own people
both at NATO and DOD.
I was sorry to miss the discussion with ASSK but there are more events with her tomw. We are working hard on getting
the engagement of Burmese women into the formal peace structures being put in place to end the ethnic conflicts.
I also met with Vivian Redding at the EU who, despite her efforts, is unlikely to get a quota for women on public boards
of directors adopted. She too expressed her admiration of you and your leadership.
In addition to everything that's been said about Chris Stevens, he really understood the important role the women in
Libya were playing in peace and security. Whenever I met with Libyan women at meetings in the region, they went out
of their way to tell me how much he supported them and how much affection they had for him. Such an awful loss.

Published September 21, 2012
BENGHAZI, lli3YA — Hundreds of protesters angry over last week's killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya stormed the
compound of the Islamic extremist militia suspected in the attack, evicting militiamen and setting fire to their building
Friday.
In an unprecedented show of public anger at Libya's rampant militias, the crowd overwhelmed the compound of the
Ansar Al-Sharlah Brigade in the center of the eastern city of Benghazi.
Ansar Al-Shariah fighters initially fired in the air to disperse the crowd, but eventually abandoned the site with their
weapons and vehicles after it was overrun by waves of protesters shouting ""No to militias.""
""I don't want to see armed men wearing Afghani-style clothes stopping me in the street to give me orders, I only want to
see people in uniform,"" said Omar Mohammed, a university student who took part in the takeover of the site, which
protesters said was done in support of the army and police.
No deaths were reported in the incident, which came after tens of thousands marched in Benghazi against armed
militias. One vehicle was also burned at the compound.
For many Libyans, the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was the last straw in one of the biggest
problems Libya has faced since the ouster and death of longtime dictator Moamrnar Qaddafi around a year ago -- the
multiple mini-armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades are stronger than the
regular armed forces and police.
The militias, a legacy of the rag-tag popular forces that fought Qaddafi's regime, tout themselves as protectors of Libya's
revolution, providing security where police cannot. But many say they act like gangs, detaining and intimidating rivals
and carrying out killings.
Militias made up of Islamic radicals like Ansar Al-Shariah are notorious for attacks on Muslims who don't abide by their
hardline ideology. Officials and witnesses say fighters from Ansar Al-Shariati led the attack on the U.S. consulate, which
killed Amb. Chris Stevens and three other Americans.
After taking over the Ansar compound, protesters then drove to attack the Benghazi headquarters of another Islamist
militia, Rafallah Sahati. The militiamen opened fire on the protesters, who were largely unarmed. At least 20 were
wounded, and there were unconfirmed witness reports of three protesters killed.
Earlier in the day, some 30,000 people filled a broad boulevard as they marched along a lake in central Benghazi on
Friday to the gates of the headquarters of Ansar Al-Shariah.
""No, no, to militias,"" the crowd chanted, filling a broad boulevard. They carried banners and signs demanding that
militias disband and that the government build up police to take their place in keeping security. ""Benghazi is in a trap,""
signs read. ""Where is the army, where is the police?""",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

On the day of the attack, U.S. officials had spotted a police officer taking photos of the compound from a villa
under construction across the streets. This was the view the officer would have had of the compound.
- Nancy A. Youssef /MCT
Even before the deadly Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and
three other Americans, diplomats from other nations and Libyan security officials had questioned the wisdom of
a U.S. decision to rely primarily on members of a local militia to protect its compound here.
Diplomats here told McClatchy that while it's customary to depend on local forces to protect diplomatic
missions, only the United States of the 10 or so foreign missions here allowed the local militia to be the first line
of defense. The others said they instead depended on military forces from their own country to provide security.
""A few months ago, there was a small attack here and the Libyans fled,"" said a diplomat from a European
nation who asked that he not be further identified so that he could speak candidly about his assessment of
security here. ""After that, I decided to only use special forces"" from his own country.
""We never considered using the brigades,"" he said, referring to the 17th of February Brigade, the local militia
that was considered the primary security force for the U.S. mission. ""We assumed the United States had a
special relationship with the brigades.""",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

---- Original Message----Original Message--Cheryl, I can't imagine what this week has been like for you but wanted to write after attending the Andrews ceremony
today. I was with some NEA hands who knew Chris well and they all noted the Secretary's visit to their offices earlier in
the week and how pitch-perfect this has been handled. The remarks today were beautiful and moving. I did not have a
personal connection to the four lost this week but the President and Secretary seemed to be speaking as well to those I
did know and still mourn. So I wanted to write to say thank you. This is among the most challenging and uncertain
periods in our history — and our nation is more fortunate than it knows to have such a steady team at the helm,

January, 2012Re: Libyan leadership and militiasRe: Libyan leadership and militias
SOURCE. Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as
the highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services,
1. During the last week of December 2011, and the first week of 2012, Libya's Prime
Minister Abdurrahim el-Keib and President Mustafa Abdul Jalil engaged in a series of
emergency planning meetings attempting to deal with specific issues threatening the stability of
the new National Transitional Council (NTC) Government. According to extremely sensitive
sources speaking in strict confidence, paramount among these issues are the questions of
disarming and rewarding the regional militias who bore the majority of the fighting against the
regime of Muammar al Qadclafi, as well as the related issue of finding ministers and senior
administrators for the new government who are acceptable to these revolutionary forces. These
individuals noted that on four occasions, beginning on December 23, 2011, groups or angry
militiamen came to el-ICeib's office and demanded better treatment, a clear message of support
for the role of Islamic law, and the removal of former Qaddafi advisors from the new
government.",jake.sullivan@univ-tlse3.fr sulliyanfostate.gott@univ-tlse3.fr

213,2012-01-09T05:00:00+00:00,"jeff thanks for reminding me. The Al-Keeb government is clearly facing many crises, the major one being the inability so
far to implement what appeared to be fairly detailed plans by Minister of Interior Fauzi and Minister of Defense Juwaili to
incorporate 25k thuwar each (total 75k) into the security forces, armed forces and into the private sector (jobs, training,
education). the main obstacles appear to be inability to implement plans by any of the GOL ministers so far and lack of
funds although we hope there will be a solution to that soon. Also, none of the militias appears willing to budge without
seeing some proof that others are also willing to do so.
I am not sure about HRC contact ascribing these problems mainly to Bel-Haj, whose star we believed had fallen over the
past several weeks. The Islamists are demanding their share of the political pie like everyone else-no more and no less. I
met with a Libyan contact yesterday who had just met with an Islamist-led militiaman from Zintan. The leader of this group
demanded that women's role be inscribed in the constitution as per Sharia'-if that did not happen this guy threatened to
take up arms again. Sarkis-the new but now deposed Economy Minister is an example of the power of the street and
different voices clamoring for different things. He was a technocrat whom we dealt with in the past but because of the
perception that he was ""part of the old regime"" he had to go even though al-Keeb regretted the decision since Sarkis was
an able technocrat. So, the bottom line is that the disarming and reintegration of the militias is not going as well as we
would have liked though the Minister of Interior told me on the margins of the PM discussion with DDCI Morrell today that
things on that score were going ""well."" One positive ray of light is that Tripoli Local Council reps told us today that they
had begun registering thuwar to determine which of the three possible categories they couid stream into. Another
disturbing tmed which may be happening is the emergence of organized crime perhaps fueled by old regime elements
including Snussi and al-Baghdadi. According to MOI sources have expressed real concern about an unholy
alliance of former Qadhafi loyalists, criminals who escaped from prison, and odd assortments of different thuwar. They are
apparently getting money, terrorizing the cities by night and engaging in human trafficking, drugs, gunrunning and alcohol
backed by old regime money. The motivation would be economic and political (creating chaos and undermining
stability). Our Legatt reps will meet with the e the Brits tomorrow to see if we can respond to MOI request for help in
training a team to deal with this possible new and troubling phenomenon. Not sure whether this crime phenomenon is
connected to the murder of my good friend Hugo deSamie, a french businessman who had been involved in deals with
the old regime and was back trying his hand with the new group.
It is not clear whether he will survive given the
intense pressure the PM is coming under from the eastern Obeidi tribes-they want one of theirs in the position as
compensation for the murder of Yusuf Obeidi.
So bottom line, there is ferment and things are not progressing as fast and as far as we would like. But let's not panic yet-
the PM is well-intentioned and the ministers are able people if they can get the means to implement their plans. I told the
PM today that we could help in various areas and that we could be as discrete as need be in light of his formidable
political vulnerabilities. By the way, he may be planning to visit Washington and NY end of January-ealry February period.jeff thanks for reminding me. The Al-Keeb government is clearly facing many crises, the major one being the inability so

January 23, 2012Re Libya internal strife
SOURCE, Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as
the highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. On the evening of January 22, 2012, according to an official with access to the
leadership of the National Transitional Government (WC), Libyan President Mustafa Abdul
Jalil spoke at length with Prime Minister Abdurrahim el-Keib, stating in a heated exchange that
el-Keib's government must take the steps necessary to address the complaints of the demobilized
fighters from the 2011revolufion Jain pointed out that the new government has been discussing
this situation since it was formed in October 2011, and matters have now reached a crisis point,
with a group of more than 2,000 disgruntled veterans, supported by students, attacking the NTC
offices in Benghazi on January 21, destroying computer equipment and NTC files. These
demonstrators, some of whom threw Molotov cocktails at the NTC headquarters building,
continue to demand better medical care, jobs, payment for their time in the revolutionary army,
and a commitment to transparency on the part of the el-Keib regime, particularly the
appointment of cabinet members and senior officials
2. According to this source, when el-Keib replied, pointing out that demonstrators were
camped outside of his office in Tripoli He added that the government had to proceed in a
measured and professional manner, Jafil stated in angry tones, that NTC staffers were beaten and
could have been killed during the January 21 incident, pointing out that this is how the rebellion
against Muammar al Qaddafi began in February 2011. JAI also warned that Islamist leader
General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his supporters, particularly militia commanders from
Zintan, Misrata, and other western regions, are anxiously waiting for the NTC government to
collapse. Their goal, in the opinion of this individual, is to eventually move in and establish a
strict Islamic state Jalil, added that his contacts in the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood had been
in touch during the preceding week, warning that the threat from Belhaj is very real El-Keib",jake.sullivan@univ-tlse3.fr

Statement by the Director of Public Affairs for National Intelligence Shawn Turner on the intelligence
related to the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya
In the aftermath of the terrorist attack on U.S. personnel and facilities in Benghazi, Libya, the Intelligence
Community launched a comprehensive effort to determine the circumstances surrounding the assault and to
identity the mpetrators. We also reviewed all available intelligence to determine if there might be follow-on
attacks against our people or facilities in Libya or elsewhere in the world.
As the Intelligence Community collects and analyzes more information related to the attack, our understanding
of the event continues to evolve. In the immediate aftermath. there was information that led us to assess that the
attack began spontaneously following protests earlier that day at our embassy in Cairo. We provided that initial
assessment to Executive Branch officials and members of Congress, who used that information to discuss the
attack publicly and provide updates as they became available. Throughout our investigation we continued to
emphasize that information gathered was preliminary and evolving.
As we learned more about the attack, we revised our initial assessment to reflect new information indicating that
it was a deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists. It remains unclear if any group or
person exercised overall command and control of the attack, and if extremist group leaders directed their
members to participate. However, we do assess that some of those involved were linked to gmups affiliated
with or sympathetic to al-Qa`ida. We continue to make progress, but there remain many unanswered questions.
As more information becomes available our analysis will continue to evolve and we will obtain a more
complete understanding of the circumstances surrounding the terrorist attack.
We continue to support the ongoing FBI investigation and the State Department review of the Benghazi terrorist
attack, pmviding the full capabilities and resources of the Intelligence Community to those efforts. We also will
continue to meet our responsibility to keep Congress fully and currently informed. For its part, the Intelligence
Community will continue to follow the information about the tragic events in Benghazi wherever it leads. The
President demands and expects that we will do this, as do Congress and the American people. As an Intelligence
Community, we owe nothing less than our best efforts in this regard, especially to the families of the four
courageous Americans who lost their lives at Benghazi in service of their country

Keller hints at in the ""slack"" he'll cut us, is that our denunciations of the video aren't an effort to debate the mob; they
are an effort to give ammo to the right side to win the battle that Keller himself identifies (between extremists seeking
to put ""pressure"" on weak transitional governments and the more mainstream majority that supports those
governments). And you could say it worked. Governments stepped up. Extremist groups in Tunisia are backpedalling.
Etc.
So we need to make this argument forcefully.The Satanic Video

THE alchemy of modern media works with amazing speed. Start with a cheesy anti-Muslim
video that resembles a bad trailer for a Sacha Baron Cohen comedy. It becomes YouTube
fuel for protest across the Islamic world and a pretext for killing American diplomats. That

terrific substantive, precise, and firm in the face of some outlandish behavior. We continue to fend off questions

The Benghazi protestors appear to
be a pastiche of different groups of disaffected people including war-wounded, martyrs' families, transparency and
accountability demendeurs, and those who believe the east is once again being neglected. So the source of this report
attributing the whole thing to war-wounded does not jive, although they may have been the ones who carried out
the violent acts. The Belhaj bogeyman is a bit overplayed-no doubt his military influence has waned but he does remain
a player —one of many —looking to make political gain in this new environment The proposition that he is just lying in
waiting to take advantage of the current stability to move in and establish an Islamic state appears a bit
exaggerated. Minister of Labor Rajbani (who has his own axes to grind) said there is now a group of six ministers (I need
to clarify whether this is with al-Keeb's knowelcige or not) who are serving as the ""cohones"" of the cabinet and taking
decisions the others won't al-Keeb Is proceding cautiously (that is his strength and weakness) and that is the problem-
this is really the time for a ""war-time"" cabinet not the cautious approach he appears to be taking does not suit this volatile
time Let's see what the meeting today between the NTC and the government produces—the benghazi protests, the Bani
Walid conflict and the various other incidents that have flared up in recent days point to the need for some real drastic
movement in the DDR process and in the other issues that engender current dissatisfaction among the populace. I can
really comment on the points regarding foreign contracts except to say it rings true given the current governments
reluctance to make any significant decisions, especially regarding past or future issues of money. The Hefter piece also
sounds a bridge too far given al-Keeb's disposition. But I do agree that it is not too late if this government can just
organize itself and take some fundamental decisions to i mprove liquidity, get the real war-wounded good treatment and
push the MOD and MOI to speed up the DDR process.Interested, as always, in your views.

Benghazi's Deep Throat fingers Islamist Leaders for
Attacks as State Dept Criticized on Consular Security
Posted on 12/19/2012 by Juan
The report saying that security was inadequate at the compound that the US had adopted as its ad hoc
consulate in Benghazi, Libya, dominates today's headlines. That conclusion is obvious. The
""consulate"" was just a private residence taken over for this purpose by the US in the city. It was not
constructed to be a US government building in a potentially hostile city.
I met a person who worked there when I was in Benghazi in June, and she told me that it wasn't even
clear if the consulate would be retained after the first of this year. It was possibly temporary,
depending on Congressional funding. (The Tea Party House hasn't been good on meeting requests for
embassy security funds).
The more interesting question than why ad hoc arrangements should have been made for a consulate
during and after the Libyan revolution (the answer to which seems fairly obvious) is, who is
responsible for the string of assassinations and acts of violence in the city, of which the RPG attack on
the consulate on September 11 was only one? Benghazi, with a population of over one million in a
country of 6.5 million, is Libya's second largest city and was the epicenter of the revolution against the
government of Muammar Qaddafi in 2011.
On November 22, Benghazi police chief Farej Darssi was assassinated. In October a police colonel
barely avoided death— his car was wired to explode. A Libyan intelligence officer was killed in
September. A general was assassinated in August. Some of these figures had worked for Qaddafi but
had defected to the revolution. Qaddafi's security forces were responsible for the 1996 massacre of
hardline fundamentalists at Abu Salim prison, and for making others just disappear. Likely the same
shadowy cells that attacked the US consulate are behind the attacks on Benghazi police and army
officers.
There may have been a break in the case. Last Saturday, Benghazi security forces loyal to the elected
government in Tripoli, captured a man they suspected of being involved with the groups behind the
violence. And, he appears to have been willing to spill the beans. So let's call him the Libyan Deep
Throat.
Deep Throat is so knowledgeable about the conspiracies facing the city and so dangerous to those
hatching them that the latter immediately attempted to spring him from jail.http://www.juancole.com/2012/12/benghazis-criticizes-consular.html

2. According to this source, when el-Keib replied, pointing out that demonstrators were
camped outside of his office in Tripoli. He added that the government had to proceed in a
measured and professional manner, Jalil stated in angry tones, that NTC staffers were beaten and
could have been killed during the January 21 incident, pointing out that this is how the rebellion
against Muammar al Qaddafi began in February 2011. Jalil also warned that Islamist leader
General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his supporters, particularly militia commanders from
Zintan, Misrata, and other western regions, are anxiously waiting for the NTC government to
collapse. Their goal, in the opinion of this individual, is to eventually move in and establish a
strict Islamic state. Jalil, added that his contacts in the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood had been
in touch during the preceding week, warning that the threat from Belhaj is very real. El-Keib",robert.russo@univ-tlse3.fr

are going smoothly throughout most of Libya (Ajdabiya being the exception, where some ballots were sabotaged
requiring voting in some centers to be postponed for a few hours). Factoring in time to tally votes and process appeals,
the UN and the Libyan elections commission are anticipating announcing final results by late July. The expectation is
that the TNC will remain in power until the new congress is seated.
Sett McCain and I toured the new parliament this afternoon, where we encountered a TNC member, an engineer and a
couple of UN experts reviewing progress on the interior decor of the main chamber. They are racing to get the chamber
finished in time for the first session. The UN is offering technical assistance to the secretariat of the new congress,
ranging from parliamentary procedure to legislative drafting. They're even helping to plot out the choreography of the
first sessions.
The atmosphere in Tripoli is very festive. The gov't declared today a holiday and people are driving around honking and
waving flags and making peace sign gestures. We visited several polling stations where we found people patiently
waiting in lines (gender segregated) lvlcCain was applauded and thanked for his support wherever we went.

It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel, in Benghazi, Libya yesterday.
Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and Foreign Service Information Management
Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all
their families and colleagues.
A 23. year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he sustained in the attack on
our office in Benghazi.
I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke eloquently about his
passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This assignment was only the latest in his more than two
decades of dedication to advancing closer ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a
Peace Corps Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans on the ground
in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to build the foundation for a new, free
nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's
values and interests, even when that meant putting himself in danger.
Sean was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten
years ago. Like Chris, Sean was one of our best. All the Americans
we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this vicious and violent attack that took their
lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan people reach for a better future.
America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country. We are honored by
the service of each and every one of them.

Jim and tom F comments in email below.
Cdmi like virtually everything in the two-pager, and I do agree with Tom on the notion of elevating the ""national interest""
and security elements of this, both because those have become part of her ""brand,"" and also to help flesh it out in a way
that both gives it the widest reach, and also protects it from attack.
some ways to consider doing that might be to just ensure that the overarching description of it ""call out"" the national
interest/security reasoning at work - something like ""America has the opportunity and the responsibility to lead in the
creation of a network of principled partnerships that will serve our national interest, enhance our security and build the
capacity of people and nations to solve global problems and give everyone more power to reach their potential.""
(i inserted ""network"" of principled partnerships because i think it kind of alludes to both the diversity of the kinds of
partnerships as well as to the influence of technology on building them...not a ""must have"" but just a thought....in the
same vein, i don't know whether there might be an advantage in alluding to a network of ""pragmatic and principled
partnerships"" or ""practical and principled partnerships"" just to ensure it's got that pragmatism aspect of it sharply

defeated and any collateral damage inflicted on private people by SL govt in process is ok... They also believe Tigers are
better at propaganda than SL govt...
I have no idea what reality is... I know all about the conflict because there's been so much written over time but no idea

positive footing and she was hoping for a ""women-to women"" one to one private meeting with you. She is happy to
come to Washington if you could make some time available.

made a lot of difference already with her education city and with the Shaffalah Centre for people with Disabilities in

Pls print.Hillary,
The email below from Sally Osberg, President of the Skoll Foundation reminds me that right after the Skoll Forum in
Oxford, I wrote Cheryl indicating your interest in meeting with Jeff Skoll. I sent another email on this and a couple of
other meetings I think important (Jacqueline Novogratz, Acumen) but have never heard anything from her. I really do
think it would be valuable for you to meet Jeff Skoll, and to talk with Jacqueline about Pakistan, in particular, but
Acumen more generally. Perhaps I should go through the public-private partnerships office?
Re if AID still isn't done, if he'd come in, you might consider whether he should be asked to undertake AID — he'd B6
need a very good managerial #2 so he didn't get bogged down, but he was your first archetype of the kind of ""moral
authority"" and leadership you wanted, and people would certainly perceive him to have been ""worth the wait"".
Good luck with all you're juggling. This has to be a particularly demanding week, in a string of them.

Please call me about this if you have a moment. The message is self-explanatory, apparently there is no american voice
in place to speak out or lead on this issue so --there is no voice. I believe you know Bruce Ramer who is my brother-in-
law, former president of american jewish committee and well-respected entertainment lawyer in la. And, he is right.
Look forward to seeing you next week in washington. Best, brian
Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless HandheldBrian, First, thanks for a nice family morning and for breakfast. Always fun, always interesting and always fulfilling.
Below is a sample of the kind of emails I sent to various people (studio heads; Dan Glickman; etc), which have started to
generate concern, interest and action. AJC is also active on other fronts, as well.
Just below the email you will find the news item which first called this abomination to my attention.
I hope you can enlist Hilary's support (and please give her my personal best). We need, for many reasons, to have the
US protest and condemn this outrageous boycott and to oppose the anti-Semitism inherent in it; cf Durban. The
organizers of the festival must be convinced to reverse themselves. This, because of the inherent wrongness of it and
that if it succeeds, it will encourage and motivate those who fomented the boycott to other, probably even worse,
action. For example, there is in effect or pending (I am not certain which) a UK-Israeli treaty on film production; we
should cut off at the pass any attempts to derail it.
Our Embassy in London does not yet have our Ambassador. The charge d'affaires is Robert Lebaron who I hope will
receive appropriate instructions from DOS. If he acts quickly, it is likely that other nations will follow suit; again,
compare Durban.
This is truly appalling and serious and I earnestly solicit your assistance with the Secretary, and through you my earnest
solicitation of her assistance.
With appreciation and love, Bruce
PS Naturally, you are free to share this email.
Dear Michael, This is disgusting and outrageous.
If you have any films in the festival or can lean on anyone else who does, please get them withdrawn. We would not
boycott the films of any other nation, even those we consider outlaws. Neither should they. And they should learn that
boycotts beget boycotts.
Thanks for whatever help you can be.
Warmest regards. Bruce

In certain ways, Daniel Yohannes of Denver is not your typical museum trustee. At 17, with $150, he moved from
Ethiopia to Los Angeles as an exchange student without knowing a soul. He immediately got a part-time job as a stock
boy in a clothing store and went on to support himself through high school, Claremont McKenna College and the MBA
program at Pepperdine. He began his banking career as a teller at Security Pacific Bank.
But in other ways, Yohannes is the very portrait of a board member. At 55, the president and CEO of M&R Investments,
a firm specializing in real estate, financial institutions and energy. A former vice chairman of U.S. Bancorp. A few years
ago he started a bank in San Francisco on the side. His board membership extends from the financial (a Fortune 100",cheryl.mills@univ-tlse3.fr

Jim's thoughts on doc
CdmI think this is very good. I really like the emphasis on security, which is part of her brand, and very relevant (I always
have in the back of my mind the possibility that great tragedy will strike again, so we need to prepared to deal with that
reality, should it come about some day).
I like combining that with the notion of prosperity and humanity, which together covers so much ground - from
economic development to human rights.
A couple miscl thoughts --
- in terms of promoting prosperity/economic development, might there be a reason to technological advancement
(giving people access to education and technological tools that can help them in terms of both education and access to
social networks and other avenues for advancement). You do reference education in the development arena, and in
prosperity, so that's good).
- there isn't much here mentioning democratization, freedom, etc. I know that is probably dicey given the multitude of
governments we want to partner with that aren't ready to talk that talk, but still think it needs to be incorporated in
some aspect of a mission statement.
- really like strong reference to women as a key to economic and social stabilization. That ties into her ""brand"" and into
a reality. I know when the First Ladies of Africa came out here to LA, one of the desires was to try to draw them into an
alliance that might transcend their own national differences and create cross-border force for positive change. A friend",huma.abedin@univ-tlse3.fr

Following a few discussions with Dick Gephardt - I have pleasure in laying out fairly detailed information about a
conference that is being held in Demark on 3-4 December 2009.
We have made the note reasonably in-depth so hopefully will provide you with sufficient background. The organisers of
the event which are ATP - the largest Danish Pension Fund and the Climate Consortium Denmark are being sponsored
and backed by the Danish government and they were very hopeful that Hillary would be able to be the key note speaker
at the conference for reasons that they have identified in the attached briefing document.
We were hoping to establish whether this event would be of interest for Hillary to appear and if she was available we
would then arrange for the formal invite to be sent out by the Danish Government.
If we can provide any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.
With very Best wishes

National Security Threats Posed by Climate Change and Our Dependence on Foreign Oil
Dear,
I've spent my entire life working to keep America safe. That is why I feel compelled to add my voice to the growing
number of senior U.S. generals, admirals, and veterans calling for immediate actions to address the alarming national
security threats posed by climate change and our dependence on foreign oil.
We import over half our oil from countries that are hostile to us. Last year, we paid over $255 BILLION to Middle
Eastern countries that are the primary funders for terrorists groups like Al Qaeda and to Russia and Venezuela.
The U.S. consumes more energy than any other country in the world, so increased U.S. fuel efficiency standards and
reliance on renewable energy will directly affect not only our own economic prosperity, but world energy prices as well.
That matters because when the cost of a barrel of crude oil increases $10, the Ayatollah Khamenei in Iran gets $15
billion more, Putin in Russia gets an extra $36 billion, and Hugo Chavez in Venezuela gets an additional $10 billion to
prop up his anti-American regime.
Furthermore, since the military is the largest energy consumer in the U.S., that same $10/barrel increase means DoD has
to spend $1.3 billion more on fuel, which is equal to the entire procurement budget for the Marine Corps.
But our reliance on foreign oil does more than fund our enemies. The droughts, famines, and rising sea levels caused by
climate change pose perhaps the greatest destabilizing influence the world will face over the next 50 years.
Forty percent of the world's population gets its drinking water from mountain glaciers that could disappear within
decades. Without forceful and decisive action, conflict will likely erupt among climate refugees competing for dwindling
resources and political destabilization will create ungoverned spaces where terrorists can flourish. These effects were
seen in Afghanistan in the 1990s and are currently being experienced in Somalia and Darfur, were genocide erupted
following the drying of Lake Chad, leaving 300,000 dead.
We must act now. A huge coalition of faith and military leaders have joined together to support efforts in Congress to
pass effective climate change legislation this year. We need you to add your voice to ours by taking 1 minute to
encourage your Member of Congress to support this effort. Please click here to email or call your Representative.",lauren.jiloty@univ-tlse3.fr

Was going to write earlier re Palau willingness to take the 17 Guantanamo Uighurs -- but see the story has now
broken. I am now representing Palau, primarily re extension of free association w/ the U.S. In touch w/Fried's office re
Uighurs. Big commitment for Palau since Chinese tourism was planned and its close geographically, etc. but their
premium is on U.S. relations (as sadly demonstrated by the loss of a Palauan in the U.S. Army in Afghanistan last week).
Also, just FYI now, I've been concerned that the Budget includes a far too low placeholder for free association
extension aid, $45-9 m over 10 years, although the aid is to be based on a joint review of need that will really begin with
a Palauan presentation Friday. (I think the number didn't reflect any rethinking by this Administration). The U.S. is to
respond in a month.

NEW INFORMATION
About 45 minutes ago, Telesur had images of apparent pro-Zelaya supporters at the airport fence and trying to pull it
down. Security forces inside the airport compound re-deployed to prevent a breach. It seems they did use white smoke
or gas to deter protestor action. Telesur also reported that shots were fired into the assembled crowd and that one or
two people were shot and killed (no names or confirmation). Images of ambulances in crowd were visible.
It seems now that the fence has been breached and a handful of pro-Zelaya supporters move in and out of airport area
to pick up rocks and retreat (there is open, clear area inside fence, possible construction). Security forces have taken up
positions on tarmac, presumably to prevent further incursion.",millscdstate.gov.@univ-tlse3.fr lona.valmoro@univ-tlse3.fr

Saddam's rule 'better' for gay Iraqis
Investigating reports of the murder and torture of gay men in Iraq, Ashley Byrne found that some gays found Saddam
Hussein's dictatorship preferable to the threat of violence they face today. Some readers will find parts of his report
disturbing.
There has been so much news of death and destruction from Iraq that the position of sexual minorities is rarely touched
on in the mainstream media.
But stories of torture and murder of gay Iraqis, particularly men, have been emerging in the gay press for several years.
Investigating these stories for a BBC Radio 5 Live documentary, Gay Life After Saddam, I've heard a range of views about
the deteriorating conditions for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) people.
Some say the violence has intensified in the past few months. Others say killings run into the hundreds and have been

free association aid. FYI only, the Palauans were insulted by the nature and depth of the response to their proposal as
well as the content and the overall approach. They are even privately questioning the relationship. (This hasn't affected
their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts.
At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the
United States delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent
communications.
While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation
on specific elements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific
issues, the Palau delegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United
States delegation did not seriously respond, as required by the Compact, to the operational requirements of the
Government of Palau or to Palau's comprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-
sufficiency.
In light of the foregoing, the Palau delegation has determined that it must now return to Palau to discuss with President
Toribiong the next steps that Palau needs to take regarding the Compact. Thank you.

569,2009-07-14T04:00:00+00:00,"Pls print for me.Dear Secretary Clinton,
Your assistant, Lona Valmoro, and I have been exchanging emails on trying to find a time to meet in Washington on July
30. I am hopeful something can be worked out. In the meantime, I wanted to take you up on your offer below and
provide you with a few thoughts on China prior to the upcoming SED on July 27-28. I send you this note from Beijing
(midway through a four-day visit) via Blackberry -- so apologies for any typos.
1. Mounting signs of social instability have intensified China's growth imperatives. Beijing insiders are very concerned
about the Xinjiang uprising; Hu Jintao's pre-G-8 exit validates those concerns. Coming on the heels of last year's
problems in Tibet, social instability can no longer be dismissed as an isolated occurrence. In both cases, my sources claim
growth shortfalls have exacerbated ethnic disturbances. China's recent fiscal stimulus -- especially infrastructure
initiatives in the West -- attempts to address this. Growth has long been modern China's antidote to the risks of social
instability.
2. A massive external demand shock dilutes the growth antidote that China needs to contain social instability. In fact,
the global recession adds a new risk factor to China's social instability equation. The government has confirmed reports
of over 20 million layoffs of migrant workers in export-intensive Guangdong Province -- a direct outgrowth of the
collapse of Chinese exports over the past year (from growth of +25% in mid-2008 to a contraction of -25% in May 2009).
Driven by a record capitulation of the American consumer -- real US consumption down by -1.8% over the past four
quarters (a 58-year record plunge) -- China's biggest source of end-market export demand has been hit with an
extraordinary shock. To the extent there is more to come on this count -- and that remains my best guess, although with
a less dramatic US consumption adjustment than we saw over the past year -- external demand pressures will continue
to undermine China's growth imperatives and feed heightened concerns over social instability.
3. China's stimulus package is a ""quick fix"" that can only exacerbate its already worrisome structural imbalances. The
focus of the stimulus is on its two most unbalanced sectors -- fixed investment and exports, which collectively account
for about 80% of Chinese GDP. Fully 72% of the RMB4 trillion fiscal initiative announced last November goes to
infrastructure. And there are aggressive incentives directed at exporters (i.e., tax rebates, ""buy China"" procurement
incentives, SME credit support, etc.). Moreover, there has been a huge push of State-directed bank lending -- the full-
year 2009 lending target was hit in mid-April! This latter initiative underscores the risks of deteriorating loan quality and
associated banking problems down the road. Meanwhile, despite public claims to the contrary, very little has been done
to stimulate the one sector in China that needs it the most -- internal private consumption. Social safety net efforts are
still puny -- the recent healthcare plan translates into US$30 per person for three years and the National Social Security
Fund only has enough assets to provide about $90 of lifetime social security benefits per worker! This forces fear-driven
-- or precautionary -- saving that, in turn, inhibits the consumer-led impetus a Chinese rebalancing urgently needs.Dear Stephen,
Delighted to hear from and about you. I'm looking forward to seeing you when you're in DC and I'm copying my
assistant, Lona Valmoro, so she can work w you to schedule a visit. Your timing is impeccable since I will be co-chairing w
Tim Geithner the first Strategic and Economic Dialogue w the Chinese on July 27-28 in DC. So if you have any thoughts
you want to share before our meeting, pls pass them on.
I hope all is well w you and yours. Happy 4th! All the best, HDear Secretary Clinton,
Although I regretfully missed seeing you on your swing through Beijing earlier this year, I will be back in Washington on
July 30. Would love the opportunity to meet with you briefly and give you up update on my thoughts/ insights into China
and the rest of the region. The story is not quite as neat as it appears on the surface. Despite all the hype, this region
remains an export machine that should struggle in the aftermath of the crisis -- with important implications for many of
the global economic issues you are facing. I have had extensive meetings throughout the region over the past few
months and would welcome the opportunity to provide you with a first hand assessment.",lauren.jiloty@univ-tlse3.fr

An area where you could save time and space (but I didn't try to change it) would be to shorten the parts where you talk
about Israel and Palestine and about Iraq and Afghanistan - it seems to me that those are tactical discussions of an
existing issue, and somewhat removed from the more abstract and strategic policy outline she's otherwise aiming at

Dear Cheryl,
Congratulations on the launch of the $20b G8 initiative. This will stand as a historic success of President Obama and
Secretary Clinton. Please do convey my personal congratulations and gratitude to Secretary Clinton if you have a

595,2009-07-19T04:00:00+00:00,"Thx for sending. I've forwarded to Jake Sullivan in my office to follow up.Below is the statement of very impressive Palau reps at the end of a session of required meetings on the next phase of
free association aid. FYI only, the Palauans were insulted by the nature and depth of the response to their proposal as
well as the content and the overall approach. They are even privately questioning the relationship. (This hasn't affected
their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts.
At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the
United States delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent
communications.
While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation
on specific elements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific
issues, the Palau delegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United
States delegation did not seriously respond, as required by the Compact, to the operational requirements of the
Government of Palau or to Palau's comprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-
sufficiency.
In light of the foregoing, the Palau delegation has determined that it must now return to Palau to discuss with President
Toribiong the next steps that Palau needs to take regarding the Compact. Thank you.

extracted from the eastern war zone and widely used by our consumer electronics industry. ""Clinton's visit to Goma
tomorrow provides the opportunity for the United States to deepen its overdue engagement in search of a solution for
the world's deadliest war,"" Enough Project co-founder John Prendergast said today.
""Tantalum helps cool cell phones and laptops. Tungsten enables the vibration function in a cell phone. Tin is a solder for
most circuit boards in nearly every electronic product. And gold is used to encase wiring. Until the trade in minerals
becomes legal and transparent, there will be no peace in Congo,"" Prendergast said.
Clinton earlier highlighted the role of conflict minerals in what she called ""the unspeakable violence against women and
girls in eastern Congo.""
""It is the worst example of man's inhumanity to women. And women are being used in conflicts. Now, what are the
conflicts about? Well, yes, there are tribal and other reasons why the conflicts are going on, but get below the surface.
It's because there are mines in eastern Congo that produce the minerals that go into our cell phones and our other
electronics. There is a lot of money being made by a lot of people, but it sure isn't helping the people of the DRC,""
Clinton said in an interview in Nairobi.
The majority of sexual violence cases reported in North Kivu since January have been attributed to government soldiers
according to the Congo Advocacy Coalition, a group of 88 humanitarian and human rights organizations, including
Enough Project. Early last month the Congolese Government announced a policy of ""zero tolerance"" for abuses
committed by army soldiers and said commanders who permit their troops to commit such crimes will be held
responsible but to date, only a handful of officers have been arrested.",lissa.muscatine@univ-tlse3.fr

A New Approach for Missile Defense
By Hillary Clinton
Iran's development of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles poses a clear and growing threat to the security of our
European allies and our own forces stationed in the region. That is why President Obama announced yesterday that the
United States is ready to deploy missile defenses in Europe specifically geared toward stopping these missiles. This is a
threat we cannot ignore.
Previous missile defense efforts have focused on protecting against intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching
the United States, but our intelligence now shows that the threat from these long-range weapons has not progressed as
quickly as had been feared. In contrast, evidence indicates that Iran is developing short- and medium- range missiles
that will eventually enable it to target most of Europe, the Caucuses and the Middle East, including U.S. and NATO
forces.
We deeply appreciate the willingness of the Czech and Polish Governments to host the original missile defense
architecture on their soil, and the decision to deploy other systems to better meet this growing threat came as a result
of a long and careful review of our policies, capabilities, and requirements. This decision does not alter the unshakeable
commitment of the United States to the security of these vital NATO allies. Rather, it reflects our determination to
jointly meet the threats that endanger us all.",cheryl.mills@univ-tlse3.fr

We are likely to have one candidate against Hosni in round 4 of the UNESCO director general race on Monday.
EU Commissioner Ferraro-Waldner has pulled out formally.
Our UNESCO Amb. Killion reports that candidates Baki (Ecuador) and Bukova (Bulgaria) met Sunday night Paris time.
Baki has given Bukova an ultimatum. Either they form a unity ticket with Ivonne Baki on top or Baki leaves the race.
Tonight former Ferrero-Waldner supporters are considering how to vote. Mexican Dep Secretary for 10 issues called
me. They are wondering whether to support Baki in round 4 now that F-W is out.
I noted that we wanted the strongest of the ladies to stay in (Fyi, they both were on our list of the most qualified
candidates.) Too early a pull out could also affect the race.
The Egyptian candidate could lose because of a consolidation of alternative candidates.
I am sorry to report that the Egyptians have used harsh tactics in the halls of UNESCO. A member of the U.S. delegation
has seen a member of the Egyptian-hired ""public relations"" group walking around with an envelope of cash. They
pushed to have two Amb recalled. Disgust and resentment is running high.
The Egyptians are pushing delegations very hard. FM Aboul-Gheit has stopped in Paris to deal with the UNESCO race
while en route to NY for UNGA.
A/S Feltman writes that Egyptian Ambassador Shoukry has called him twice todaY with a ""message from the Foreign
Minister."" FM Aboul Gheit is angry and reports President Mubarak is angry.",huma.abedin@univ-tlse3.fr

Thanks again for Friday. Much favorable comment. Good luck at the UNGA.
President Barack Obama's announcement of a new system for protecting America's allies against Iranian missiles has
ignited charges that he is scaling back the one he inherited from George W. Bush as a concession to the Russians.
In fact, the Obama plan is a big improvement on the Bush one, and it is designed to counter an evolving Iranian threat,
not to mollify Russian anxieties.
Mr Bush's decision to put 10 missile interceptors in Poland and an associated radar in the Czech Republic was based
on a concern that Iran was developing long-range rockets that could hit the US. The Bush system would have been less
effective against shorter-range Iranian missiles, and it would have left much of Europe, notably including America's ally
Turkey, unprotected.
Over the last several years, the Iranians have shifted their efforts from developing a few long-range rockets to
deploying large numbers of shorter-range ones that pose an immediate danger to southeastern Europe and the Middle
East, as well as to US forces stationed there. Unlike Mr Bush's, Mr Obama's plan will quickly field a missile-defence
capability to address an existing threat. It can be upgraded to deal with longer-range Iranian missiles in the future.
The Central Europeans who have reacted to the decision with apprehension or alarm should recognize that the
replacement of a conceptually flawed plan with a more credible one strengthens the bonds of transatlantic defence.
The view from Moscow has been clouded by outright paranoia. Military experts there suspected that the US rockets
in Poland, while advertised as defensive, could be used offensively, even pre-emptively, against Russia. Laying to rest
that far-fetched scenario was not the prime motivation for Mr Obama's decision, nor should it have been. However, by
removing what has been a gratuitous irritant in bilateral relations, the president has improved the prospects for US-
Russian arms control negotiations now underway in Geneva.
Those talks could produce by December a new treaty reducing numbers of strategic — that is, intercontinental —
weapons. If ratified by the US Senate (which will not be easy, given the ferocity of the partisan wars in Washington), the
US and Russia will be on track for further reductions in the future. Mr Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev,
who are due to meet in New York this week, have jointly called for the eventual goal of eliminating nuclear weapons.
As they and their successors take steps in that direction, they will have to grapple with a stark paradox of the nuclear",sta.ibott@univ-tlse3.fr strobe.talbott@univ-tlse3.fr

Questions have been raised regarding remarks by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on September 30 before the United
Nations Security Council on the adoption of a resolution to combat sexual violence in armed conflict. In her statement,
she said that we have seen rape used as a tactic before in a number of countries, including Sri Lanka.
Regarding the Secretary's reference to Sri Lanka in her address, we want to be clear. Over the course of the difficult
conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), stretching into this
decade, the State Department as well as credible human rights organizations reported numerous cases of rape and
sexual violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government. This was
the basis for the Secretary's statement. At the same time, in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009,
though we remained deeply concerned about reports of extrajudicial killings, disappearances and mistreatment of
detainees, we have not received reports that rape and sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have in
other conflict areas around the world. We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context.
These questions should not detract from the specific actions that Sri Lanka needs to take now. With the end of the
military conflict, Secretary Clinton believes strongly that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the
promotion of peace and the protection of human rights. The government of Sri Lanka should release more than 250,000
displaced persons who are still confined in camps, and lead a process of genuine political and social reconciliation. The
United States stands ready to assist and support the people of Sri Lanka with these critical challenges.pverveer <pverveer

Here is what we have come up with as agreed language from Bob, Eric, Mike, Melanne, Lissa and me. This can be used
for the letter and for press guidance. Melanne will send a letter to the GOSL and perhaps the UN Permrep. We will ask
the Post to release the letter to journalists in Colombo once it is received. I will schedule a press briefing at the Foreign
Press Center early this week, which will attract a good number of Asian journalists, and make sure the question is asked
so we can put it in proper context. We will have it for guidance in the Main State briefing if asked. PJ
BEGIN TEXT
Questions have been raised regarding remarks by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on September 30 before the United
Nations Security Council on the adoption of a resolution to combat sexual violence in armed conflict. In her statement,
she said that we have seen rape used as a tactic before in a number of countries, including Sri Lanka.I'm happy to have Melanne send it as letter to GOSL Ambassador and maybe UN Rep and only release to SL and related
outlets.; pvervee <pvervee
We are waiting for DRL to clear the language. I will call Mike and/or Karen now. Everyone else is comfortable. Then we
will get it to you and put it out in Melanne's voice. You'll have something very soon.

926,2009-11-02T05:00:00+00:00,"Dear Nancy--
I very much want to meet and we've been trying to pin my schedule down enough to offer a date. The only times I see
for me before December are Nov 21-23 or sometime in the second or third weeks of December. I'm copying Cheryl so
you two can try to find a time that works.
As to the names, I think they're all worth inviting w the hope they can come. Let's do it! Best, HHillary,
I admire the way you handled yourself during your trip to Pakistan. It reminds me of the daunting job before you and it's
potential.
Successfully engaging the power of the DOS and the array of relevant external relationships on behalf of your goals will
remain a central challenge.
As we discussed, gathering a handful of loyal and trusted outside advisors could provide a valuable tool in this regard.
Given your late October or early November target for the first meeting, I have been working with Cheryl to come up with
a date. I guess given all that is going on possible dates seem to continually slip away.
I would understand if, in the context of everything on your plate this advisory group is just not practical. However, if you
do feel that such a gathering would be helpful and want to proceed, I believe you need to step in, select the initial date
or dates (with risk that it may need to change) and extend the invitations. A quick note to Mickey, Gordon, Maggie and
any others you want to include. Others mentioned so far include Sandy Berger, Strobe Talbott and Elaine Kamarck.
For at least the first gathering, you may want to consider two parts. A dinner, breakfast or other informal event plus a
more structured meeting would create the opportunity for informal discussion and time for reflection.
In the event you do want to move forward, I am happy to assist in any way that may be useful. Please know that I in no
way want to push this beyond where you may want to go.

building and outside that this is a new level of creating content/video that is engaging, interesting, educating and that
can have long term value for State and partners to use. Bottom-line, we have done something new in raising

dirty work.
To now even consider giving the Taliban a pass after harboring terrorists who committed direct attacks on new York and
Washington defies the imagination. This wasn't some embassy bombing but a strike right at our country. The white

B6Dear Cheryl:
To update you on H1N1 and make a recommendation as we move forward.
I have asked to take the lead in the H1N1 negotiations, and she has been participating in the meetings with
WH, HHS, DOD and others. At this time, she is leading the discussions with other donors — UK, Australia, Swiss and
others — so they can work in a coordinated fashion under our leadership. Her expertise and knowledge in this area has
really helped in interacting with HHS and addressing the technical issues. She has also participated in meetings with Jack
Lew. I expect that this effort will require a considerable amount of her time for the next few weeks.
With the departure of and because we are in the middle of addressing the H1N1 pandemic, I recommend B5

hope to establish a Health Directorate, and expect to have that in place in approximately six months. This responsibility

I would be happy to talk about this if useful.

Spoke to the person you recommended on Friday. Sounds like he is comfortable and even surprised that Pakistanis are
doing more. And maybe he will find some more ways to help, like the helicopter leasing. When I mentioned that
someone deep in the ISI must be happy that Al Qaeda's alive, so we don't abandon Pakistan again, he chuckled.
I talked about the ""vetting"" for intelligence. I also talked ""defeat strategy,"" and the need for something more than just
deploying more forces and hoping the training for the Afghans will work.
I continue to be struck by the parallels to Vietnam, and especially Johnson's inability to resist escalation, and his
advisor's continued ""incrementalism.""
But I'm encouraged by the pace of the review. Seems that there's sufficient time to consider this from all angles.
I can imagine there are those arguing that we just need to fill the gap while we enlarge the Afghan army. That we help
the Pakistanis but not press them to the point of being unpleasant. And that too much focus on Osama and al-Zawahiri
raises the risk of public failure if we don't get them. There is much logic to this, but it has a strong tint of incrementalism.Dear Hillary,

points. We decided the best language would be for the Secretary to say that if UNSYG cannot co-host, that she would
welcome the participation of his representative. The important point here is that we do not want the FAO head —
Jacques Diouf — to end-up co-hosting the UNGA event, and everyone agreed there was a danger Ban ki-Moon would

necessary to give Blackwater a short (perhaps 2 months) extension until the successor is ready to perform. M is talking

cdmDear Cheryl and Jake,
I wanted to let you know that after a great deal of soul-searching, I have decided to leave the State Department in about
a month.
This was an exceptionally difficult decision; one of the most difficult I have made in my life. It has been a honor and a
real joy to have been part of the team here at State; the past year has been one of the most enriching experiences of my
career. I am leaving only for personal reasons; after pushing myself as hard as I possibly could the last several years, I
need to do this for myself, to spend some time away from work with my family and friends and reenergize.

rare privilege, and I cannot stress enough how appreciative I am. I hold the entire team here in the highest possible

1132,2009-11-21T05:00:00+00:00,"Finally!!! Who didn't vote?This evening cloture was invoked on the motion to proceed to Majority Leader Reid's health care bill, 60 to 39.
It was a straight party line vote. Despite some early concern over how they would vote, Senators Ben Nelson, Landrieu,
and Lincoln voted with the caucus. Each has warned they're not a guaranteed ""yes"" vote on final passage.
Senators voted from their seats, and Senator Dodd sat in the chair during the vote. The vote was followed by brief
applause.
Per the UC agreement negotiated by Reid and McConnell, this evening's cloture vote will also double as the vote on the
underlying motion to proceed, meaning the Senate will recess after the vote and will be on the health care bill when it
returns from the Thanksgiving recess.Just a brief update on the Senate health care debate.
The Senate will take its first vote on health care legislation Saturday night now that Leader Reid seems to have secured
the requisite votes to invoke cloture. The vote to invoke cloture will double as a vote on the motion to proceed,
allowing senators to head home for Thanksgiving recess following the 8 p.m. vote.
If cloture is invoked, Reid would immediately call up his bill as a substitute amendment to a House measure that will
serve as the shell for the motion to proceed vote. Senator Coburn had threatened to require the clerk to read the 2,000-
page bill following the vote on the motion to proceed, but Reid will call up the bill by number only, which prevents a
reading.",rodriguez.miguel@univ-tlse3.fr

tomorrow. (It is Zambia and Tanzania bringing the challenge on behalf of the AU.) I was under the impression that we
would not have to vote on the potential credentials challenges. We may have to.
We may have to vote on a motion to *deny* them credentials and exclude them. For the moment, the guidance is to
vote to credential all countries — including these two — as is customary, while conducting outreach with Tanzania,
Zambia, and the AU to explain that we have our own imperatives but we support the fact that they are taking a
principled stand.
We may have to vote on a motion to *defer* decision, which would allow them to be seated and vote but would not
formally grant credentials. For the moment, the guidance is to potentially support such a motion — this was the practice
with respect to South Africa between 1983 and 1994. Everyone is in the same place on this.

1193,2009-08-29T04:00:00+00:00,"I just stopped at and no one was home so I'm headingWASHINGTON — The United States has accused Pakistan of illegally modifying American-made missiles to expand its
capability to strike land targets, a potential threat to India, according to senior administration and Congressional
officials.
The charge, which set off a new outbreak of tensions between the United States and Pakistan, was made in an
unpublicized diplomatic protest in late June to Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani and other top Pakistani officials.
The accusation comes at a particularly delicate time, when the administration is asking Congress to approve $7.5 billion
in aid to Pakistan over the next five years, and when Washington is pressing a reluctant Pakistani military to focus its
attentions on fighting the Taliban, rather than expanding its nuclear and conventional forces aimed at India.
While American officials say that the weapon in the latest dispute is a conventional one — based on the Harpoon
antiship missiles that were sold to Pakistan by the Reagan administration as a defensive weapon in the cold war — the
subtext of the argument is growing concern about the speed with which Pakistan is developing new generations of both
conventional and nuclear weapons.
""There's a concerted effort to get these guys to slow down,"" one senior administration official said. ""Their energies are
misdirected.""
At issue is the detection by American intelligence agencies of a suspicious missile test on April 23 — a test never
announced by the Pakistanis — that appeared to give the country a new offensive weapon.",huma.abedin@univ-tlse3.fr

Your Africa trip has generated a lot of visibility and momentum on women's issues. I wanted to follow up on an idea we

you in the U.S.

Whitney Williams has joined us to flesh out a vision for a series of conferences that would bring together policymakers
and experts from the field with women you have met around the world - and people at the grassroots level in this
country.
Each conference would be followed by a special event featuring musical, cultural and culinary celebrities (yep, celebrity
chefs) from the U.S. and other countries to generate visibility online and in the entertainment media, which would reach
a lot more people than the policy conference alone.
These events would create connections among people who often work in isolation, and generate ideas for improving
policies and practices. They'd also inspire and engage a whole new generation to get involved in global women's issues.Hi! Hope you all are getting some R&R as the summer wanes.

Honduran voters have taken back their democracy from two failed leaders -- Zelaya and Micheletti -- who had driven
Honduras to isolation and despair.
The turnout (probably a record) and the clear rejection of the Liberal Party shows our approach was the right one, and
puts Brazil and others who would not recognize the election in an impossible position. As we think about what to say, I
would strongly recommend that we not be shy. We should congratulate the Honduran people, we should connect
today's vote to the deep democratic vocation of the Honduran people, and we should call on the community of
democratic nations (and especially those of the Americas) to recognize, respect, and respond to this accomplishment of
the Honduran people.
Finally, this Administration, which worked so hard to manage and resolve this crisis, should be the one who defines the
results and perceptions of today's vote, and not our critics on the Hill (who had no clear pathway to elections) or our
adversaries in the region (who never wanted this day to happen).",cheryl.mills@univ-tlse3.fr millscdstate.gov.@univ-tlse3.fr

We commend the Honduran people for having exercised peacefully their democratic, sovereign and inalienable right to
select their leaders. The apparently large and enthusiastic turnout shows that given the opportunity to express
themselves, the Honduran people have viewed the election as an important part of the solution to the political crisis in
their country.
We look forward to continuing to work with all Hondurans and encourage others in the Americas to follow the lead of
the Honduran people in helping advance national reconciliation and the implementation of the Tegucigalpa-San Jose
Accord. Significant work remains to be done to restore democratic and constitutional order in Honduras, but today the
Honduran people took a necessary and important step forward.",jake.sullivan@univ-tlse3.fr

First, some background. Mexico requested a WTO panel to resolve its tuna/dolphin dispute with the United
States U.S. measures prohibit Mexican tuna from being labeled ""dolphin safe"" even though the tuna is
harvested in accordance with the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Program. However,
dolphin population recovery has not occurred as rapidly as expected under that Program. Despite the measures,
Mexico exported about $18 million worth of tuna to the United States in 2007.

people. The ensuing piece, by the network's correspondent in Mex city, went on to cover the highlights of the visit, with
an emphasis on her admission of the US role in the drug problem. It was noted that she went down to take responsibility
not apportion blame or criticize Mexico. The basillica stop also got excellent coverage as a rightful tribute to a central
figure in Mex culture and heritage.
Ditto CNN en Espatiol and the commentariat there.
Major kudos to the trip planners and implementers!

• Original Message B6Hi Hillary, you are doing an amazing job as our Secretary of State and we are all immensely proud of you.
Really enjoyed your recent remarks regarding Afghanistan. Your words were spot on. Fyi, I will be in Kabul, Afghanistan
from 7 thru 14 April and am being hosted by Flamed Wardak, the son of the Afghanistan Secretary of Defense. Looking
forward to the visit.
There is some exciting personal news that I wanted to share with you. Although it has not yet been announced, I wanted
you to know that I recently interviewed with Cisco President ( John Chambers) and accepted a senior executive position
( effective 4 May ) to be the face and thought leader for Cisco in the field of ""Intelligent Urbanization"" with my focus
area being on Physical Safety and Security.
My wife (Faith) and I will live in Bangalore, India ( we are very excited ) and my area of responsibility will be the
emerging markets of Asia, Middle East and Africa . Since I will operate from India that particular country will be a major
focal point.
The use of the Network to improve the quality of life of Millions of people in areas such as Education, Health Care and
Security will be a major thrust of "" Intelligent Urbanization"". Faith and I are pumped up about our new overseas
adventure and the chance to work for a world class company and a superb business leader like John Chambers.
It is really a wonderful opportunity to positively impact many lives around the Globe.
Hope to perhaps call on you for a few minutes before I head over to India.
All the best and God Bless.
Sincerely, Dave

CdmErica, we are of course always ready to help. But I have to say the way in which these papers have been tasked has been,
frankly, chaotic. For two Fridays in a row we were sent taskers after 9 or 10 pm with short deadlines, and fulfillment of
one set of requirements has only led to another. We also note that there has not generally been an effort to distinguish
among bureaus in terms of substantive responsibilities and NEA has repeatedly had to refer USUN-W to other bureaus,
especially PRM and somewhat mystifyingly, 10.
lam honestly not quite sure what is needed now. There is already an 10-drafted paper on Israel in the UN that I cleared
Friday evening. Are you asking us to script her on that topic for her meetings? I doubt very much that Ambassador Rice's
interlocutors will seek to draw her into a discussion of the Israeli or Palestinian economies and I can't think why she
would raise that topic with them and what policy points we would expect her to make in the context of her visit. If you
really need background papers on the two economies, we can give you them.Maura —
Your folks have been terrific (especially Oni and Tom's team) in working with us yesterday and today to get papers ready
for the trip. We continue to scrounge up the last bits and pieces from the field and here, but we've given the main
briefing books to Amb. Rice who is digesting them now, and we'll get her add ons tomorrow.
After going through things briefly with her this afternoon, there is one request that we have on the substantive front.
We'd like to get (at whatever classification level is appropriate) really two additional meaty papers for her meetings with
Netanyahu and Liberman. These would supplement the material in her book. We are aware that these will be tough
meetings, but we also view them as a good opportunity to also cover a lot of ground. There are a lot of issues not in the",cheryl.mills@univ-tlse3.fr

Dorsainvil and which was for November 20th or 21st.The idea had been sold that Michele should not be touched as the

seeking presidential powers) which is not a bad thing under the circumstances. Apparently, she, not being amenable to
sacrificing some of her Ministers...and again, she being the one to name their replacements, has brought about the
decision to do away with her altogether. The trouble is that nobody seems willing to counter the President with whom
the instructions have originated. It is a head to head match between the Prime Minister and the President. That is
obviously not good. Nobody will stand against the President elect for the Prime Minister appointed.
I will have two meetings with separate parliamentarians tomorrow. On one end the ones voting to oust her on the
other the week opposition. The frustrating thing is that none have allegiance to her, just as none have the individual
power to stand against the vote for which consensus is being secured.
• The UN and other international players (at least locally) after having cried victory, success and democracy are reluctant
to openly and publically denounce the matter. After announcing a week or two ago that Haiti is the new place to invest,

We had asked Johnnie to address this issue based upon reports that Uganda had legislation moving up that was going to
criminalize homosexuality with the death penalty as a sanction.
cdmCheryl:
My blackberry is down so I'm sending you a quick note from Uganda via Ambassador Jerry Lanier's account.
I met this morning with President Museveni in Entebbe. I raised with him the issue of the draconian legislation
proposed to criminalize homosexual activity. Museveni was unaware of the legislation but thought it was excessive and
out of order. He said he would work with members of Parliament to revise the legislation to make it a crime for adults
to solicit or recruit minors into any homo- or heterosexual activities. Activities between consenting adults would be
stripped from the legislation. I think we rolled the worst and most concerning part of this back.

Really good editorial here. Really worth reading.
This Week in Copenhagen
December 12, 2009
Editorial
We didn't expect much from the first week of the global warming conference in Copenhagen. Countries need to do a
little posturing before getting down to the hard work, which is supposed to start on Monday. But the belligerent talk
from China seemed to go well beyond the usual positioning.
The best hope is that the talks will produce an interim understanding under which industrialized countries would
commit to fairly precise targets for reduced emissions, and others, like China, to broader but measurable goals. The
industrial countries would be expected to help poorer countries shift to less-polluting forms of energy.
That would set the stage for a legally binding deal in 2010. But there is no chance of even an interim agreement without
the enthusiastic participation of China, the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. China's absence would give other
developing countries — and the United States Senate — an excuse to do less than needed.
Beijing's recent pledge to slow the growth in emissions seemed like a positive shift in attitude. Then on Tuesday, in a
surprising show of defensiveness, China's top negotiator, Su Wei, said the greatest burden rested with the industrialized
countries and jumped on the United States, Japan and the European Union for not being aggressive enough. Another
Chinese official urged Washington to do ""some deep soul-searching"" and improve its proposal.",jake.sullivan@univ-tlse3.fr

October 27, 2009Re: Latest on EU presidency
The political timing on the EU presidency is accelerating. Sarkozy and Merkel are meeting tonight (October 18) to discuss
it. The Czech constitutional court will issue its verdict on the legality of the Lisbon treaty on November 3. Shortly after,
perhaps that week, before you meet with Merkel on November 8-9, there may be an EU Council meeting to decide the
matter. So you may want to weigh in before then.
Tony is somewhat downcast on his chances. (He met with Jim Hoagland of the Washington Post yesterday; his mood
was described to me.) The Tories have ramped up their campaign against him—not only do they not want him but they
also do not want an effective EU president. Cameron has come down on the side of the anti-EU wing of his party on this,
an easy move. In an intriguing complication, there's talk now of David Miliband becoming EU foreign secretary if Tony
does not become EU president. Miliband denied he was interested and endorsed Tony. This is part of the anti-Blair
campaign ginned up by the Tories, extended to hurt Miliband if they can. Jonathan Powell is less gloomy than Tony,
thinks everything is still in play, which is why your part in this may yet be important.",sidney.blumenthal@univ-tlse3.fr

So it's the same 6 as the P5+1, just a different name.I'm being told -- and still trying to verify -- that as of last week, we've succumbed to the Europeans'
preferred term. That there was interagency discussion of this, and that going forward, we will join the rest of
the world in calling the P5+1 the E3+3.
This is the first I've heard of this, but I will track it down.I will forward these changes - we have made a few other tweaks.
We believe that it is useful to distribute it as your brief oral testimony (you've been asked to speak for
7-10 minutes -- this is 11 or so).
On the E3+3 v. P5+1, they are identical, just different names.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

for an end to the US embargo of Cuba (Israel was the other). Even the two other states in free association with the US.
did not support the US position. Important officials in Palau wanted to abstain because of the drastic cut in U.S.
assistance that Alcy Frelick has insisted on but Pres. Toribiong decided to stick with the US. The proposal to cut the small

UNITED NATIONS, May 18 (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon plans to name former U.S.
President Bill Clinton as his special envoy to Haiti, U.N. officials said on Monday, in a move that could attract
investment in the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation and help stabilize the country. ""The announcement is
expected to come soon,"" one U.N. official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. The official said a formal
announcement could come as early as Tuesday. Clinton, who has galvanized efforts to help the impoverished
Caribbean nation recover from the devastating impact of four hurricanes last year, accompanied Ban on a trip to
Haiti earlier this year. Several other diplomats confirmed the appointment of the former president, who is trying

ROME (AP) — Italy's foreign minister has canceled a planned trip to Iran for talks on regional security issues.
The Foreign Ministry in a statement Wednesday cited a problem over the meeting place with President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. It said it regretted the ""lost opportunity"" to discuss involving Iran in the stabilization
of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini had been scheduled to depart later Wednesday.
The communiqué made no mention of reported criticism over the planned trip, nor did it mention a missile test
conducted Wednesday by Iran with a range capable of reaching Israel and U.S. Mideast bases.

BONN, Germany (AP) — Once booed at international climate talks, the United States won sustained applause Sunday
when President Barack Obama's envoy pledged to ""make up for lost time"" in reaching a global agreement on climate
change.
Todd Stern also praised efforts by countries like China to reign in their carbon emissions, but said global warming
""requires a global response"" and that rapidly developing economies like China ""must join together"" with the industrial
world to solve the problem.
The debut of Obama's climate change team was widely anticipated after eight years of obdurate participation in U.N.
climate talks by the previous Bush administration.
""We are very glad to be back. We want to make up for lost time, and we are seized with the urgency of the task before
us,"" Stern said to loud applause from the 2,600 delegates to the U.N. negotiations.
They clapped again when Stern said the U.S. recognized ""our unique responsibility ... as the largest historic emitter of
greenhouse gases,"" which has created a problem threatening the entire world.
The two-week meeting by 175 countries that began Sunday was the latest stage of talks aimed at forging a climate
change agreement to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on emissions targets for rich countries, which expires in 2012.

I have now seriously reviewed 9 candidates (and explored a handful of others who, for various reasons, I didn't feel
would be what we were looking for). Two have acceted other jobs that were already on the table before I spoke to
them (and for which they were better suited). One ( who I love) has decided her legal future requires her to come
here in a capacity other than speechwriting, and I think she's right about that
None of these candidates is over 32 years old. The best writer among them is the youngest — 24. She is intellectually
extremely mature and the only professional writer in the group.
On the other hand,
she's extremely smart and an excellent writer.
I have two more candidates who are working on second rounds of mock speeches. I need to see how quickly and
effectively they grasp directions and feedback. Hopefully one of them will work out for us.
One other prospect materialized yesterday; am waiting to get a better feel for her suitability. I'm also re-mining
journalistic contacts to see if I can possibly find a more seasoned writer from a newspaper or magazine who wants to
make the switch to government. So far that has proven futile; the few journalists who I've reached out to were not
interested in coming.

state. Obama had long wanted his former rival on his team, no matter what his friends and aides said about her
aggressive campaign... His staff opposed the idea for the most part, arguing that Clinton would never be truly loyal. But
Obama was willing to leave the primaries behind, including his own strong feelings at the time. ""I don't hold grudges,""
he told his aides. ""I don't worry about the past. I'm concerned about what happens now. If she can help me and Bill
Clinton isn't too much of a liability, we should seriously look at this."" ...
Obama was under no illusion about the legacy of the long primary season. During one transition meeting, Obama said he
wanted to offer Clinton the diplomatic job. ""I'm really interested in pursuing this, but I know she has some hard feelings
coming out of this campaign."" Emanuel and John Podesta, the former Clinton official who ran the transition, assured
Obama that she was over those hard feelings now. Obama smiled and said, ""Believe me. She's not over it yet.""
His decision to offer her the job of secretary of state came surprisingly early. Well before the end of the primaries, when
his staff and friends still felt hostile to her, Obama decided that Clinton possessed the qualities to carry his diplomacy to
the rest of the world. ""We actually thought during the primary, when we were pretty sure we were going to win, that
she could end up being a very effective secretary of state,"" he told me later. ""I felt that she was disciplined, that she was",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Pls print.CONFIDENTIAL
December 15, 2009Re: The Berlusconi assault
1. The physical attack on Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is a major political event in Italy and Europe. His
assailant is a mentally disturbed man without a political agenda who has been in and out of psychiatric care since he was
18 years old. Nonetheless, the assault has significant repercussions. It has generated sympathy for Berlusconi as a
victim—he has been obviously injured, lost two teeth and a pint of blood, and doctors will keep him in the hospital for
perhaps a week for observation. The attack comes as Berlusconi was beginning to lose political footing, having lost his
legal immunity. One court inquiry is turning up evidence of his links to the Mafia while another is examining his role in
the bribery case of British lawyer David Mills. Berlusconi's government and party have used the attack as a way to turn
the sudden sympathy for him to his advantage, claiming that his opponents have sown a climate of ""hate."" Through
demogogic appeals they are attempting to discredit and rebuff the legal proceedings against him and undermine the
investigative press. (Berlusconi is suing La Repubblica, the large independent newspaper in Rome that has been most
aggressive in digging into his affairs of all kind.)
2. It would seem proper and decent for the President to call Berlusconi to express his concern about his health and
wish him a speedy recovery, if he hasn't done so already. There are many reasons for Obama to do this, not least to
condemn violence against a democratically elected head of state. It would be awkward for the U.S. President not to call
a Western head of state of a NATO country who has been physically harmed. Berlusconi, for his part, would certainly",lauren.jiloty@univ-tlse3.fr

Berlusconi, for his part, would certainly make such a call public. It would therefore also
be awkward if a call were used only as an element in his sympathy campaign against the
court proceedings.

his conversation, but most importantly through a statement from the State Department,
also conveyed by the U.S. ambassador in Italy. The USG condemns any and all violence

Wolffe covered the entire length of Barack Obama's presidential campaign for Newsweek magazine, traveling
with the candidate and his inner circle from his announcement through election day, 21 months later.
As a political analyst on MS7VBC, he appears frequently on Countdown with Keith Olbermann and Hardball. On
NBC, he has featured as a political commentator on Meet The Press and TODAY. He features prominently in
the forthcoming HBO documentary on the Obama campaign, and played a leading role in the HBO
documentary of the 2000 Bush campaign, Journeys With George. He previously appeared on CNN and Fox
News, as well as international media including British, Canadian and Australian television.
He now writes regularly for The Daily Beast.
As Newsweek's senior White House correspondent, his cover stories included What He Believes (on Obama's

Weight of the World (how Bush handled the Lebanon war). Wolfe joined Newsweek in November 2002 as
diplomatic correspondent, covering foreign policy and international affairs. In the 2004 presidential election, he
covered the Howard Dean campaign before switching to John Kerry.
Before Newsweek, Wolfe was a senior journalist at the Financial Times, serving as its deputy bureau chief and
U.S. diplomatic correspondent in Washington. He reported on U.S. foreign policy, covered the Microsoft
antitrust trial, as well as regulatory and business issues at Treasury, the Federal Trade Commission and

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 25, 2009
STATEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT REGARDING NORTH KOREA
Today, North Korea said that it has conducted a nuclear test in violation of international law. It appears to also have
attempted a short range missile launch. These actions, while not a surprise given its statements and actions to date, are
a matter of grave concern to all nations. North Korea's attempts to develop nuclear weapons, as well as its ballistic
missile program, constitute a threat to international peace and security.
By acting in blatant defiance of the United Nations Security Council, North Korea is directly and recklessly challenging the
international community. North Korea's behavior increases tensions and undermines stability in Northeast Asia. Such
provocations will only serve to deepen North Korea's isolation. It will not find international acceptance unless it
abandons its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.
The danger posed by North Korea's threatening activities warrants action by the international community. We have
been and will continue working with our allies and partners in the Six-Party Talks as well as other members of the U.N.
Security Council in the days ahead.

Many Haitians See Bill Clinton Appointment as Setting Up Protectorate
Port-au-Prince Le Matin
June 5, 2009
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's recent appointment of former US President Clinton to serve as special envoy to
Haiti has been perceived by many groups, including lawmakers, political analysts, political leaders, and media
commentators, as a step toward putting Haiti in a protectorate or trusteeship status. They questioned in particular the
extent of Clinton's powers and the term of his mandate, wondering what role will be attributed to Haiti's elected
representatives. Several pointed out that Heidi Annabi, Ban's special representative in Haiti, and President Rene Preval
would be subservient to Clinton, their senior in rank and described by some media as Haiti's new chief. As expected,
Haitian Government officials and most foreign diplomats hailed this nomination and expressed their optimism about it.
Several political leaders objected to Clinton's being named special envoy to Haiti, saying that it showed the international
community wanted to bring Haiti under its control.
o Former Senate President Belizaire, president of the National Council of the Haitian Political Parties, pointed out that
Haiti has had a foreign force in the country, the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), since 2004 and now has
an envoy such as President Clinton who is in a ""higher position than any other UN personnel."" These both indicate the
country is being considered a ""genuine protectorate,"" according to Belizaire (Signal FM, 27 May).
o Socialist Identity and Liberty Collective spokesman Cherubin referred to Clinton's mission as an umpteenth ""civil
commission,"" alluding to the administrative steps France took to restore order and peace when Haiti was under French
rule, intended to speed up the process of ""taking charge"" of Haiti. Cherubin added that in the current international
jargon this is called ""colonialism of a third type, or colonialism of necessity""
(www.alterpresse.org, 22 May).
o According to Christian Movement for a New Haiti leader Mesadieux, Ban's decision will further help put Haiti under
foreign supervision. He asserted that the international community wants to reinforce its control over Haiti's
administration (Radio Vision 2000, 21 May).
o Dr. Eugene of the Haitian Social Christian Party, speaking on the ""Pickup Talk Show"" live from the United States, said
that ""Clinton's responsibility is to control events in Haiti and he will control them in a firm manner"" (Radio Caraibes FM,
23 May). Eugene was ""offended"" by this appointment and called it ""a shame for all Haitians"" and ""a slap in the face of
the entire nation"" (Radio Galaxie, 29 May).

of concern about growing Iranian influence in Latin America — talk of investments, projects and so forth — but so far very
little has actually appeared. In other words, the Iranians are talking a good game but not delivering. It is within this
context that Mary Beth picked up on the comment by the Secretary of this large embassy in Manangua that
It turns out is not under construction, at least not yet.
On the record, I said that the Secretary picked this up from one of her counterparts from the region during a bilateral. If
it turns out that is not happening, that's good news. The Iranians see themselves as the big winners in the second Gulf
War. They are trying to extend their influence, particularly in their own region, but elsewhere where they see possible
openings. But while they are trying to buy friends and influence people around the world, the results are clearly mixed.
The story will probably run Sunday.

You may know but for the last four years I have been working with the Qatari's and in particular with
ssues in Qatar and I have built up a good relationship with them
has approached me privately saying they are keen to get their relationship with the USA onto a more
positive footing and she was hoping for a ""women to women"" one to one private meeting with you. She is happy to
come to Washington if you could make some time available.
Is this something you would be prepared o do. is someone who has real influence in Qatar and she has
made a lot of difference already with her
which I am involved as the I am sure the conversation would not be
confined to these issues but would be about the US/Qatar relationship generally.

FROM ETHIOPIA TO L.A. WITH $150 IN HIS POCKET,
DANIEL YOHANNES BRINGS A
QUIET DETERMINATION TO HIS TRUSTEE ROLE.
By Leah Arroyo
This article was published in Museum, July/August 2008.
Trustee. The word brings to mind a venerable patrician of senior years, ""trusted"" to guide the interests of an organization or
individual with wisdom and perspective. Someone with old-boy or -girl connections, decades of expertise and, especially, big bucks—
not to mention the ability to pry others away from theirs. Ascot not required, but it couldn't hurt.
In certain ways, Daniel Yohannes of Denver is not your typical museum trustee. At 17, with $150, he moved from Ethiopia to Los
Angeles as an exchange student without knowing a soul. He immediately got a part-time job as a stock boy in a clothing store and
went on to support himself through high school, Claremont McKenna College and the MBA program at Pepperdine. He began his
banking career as a teller at Security Pacific Bank.
But in other ways, Yohannes is the very portrait of a board member. At 55, the president and CEO of M&R Investments, a firm
specializing in real estate, financial institutions and energy. A former vice chairman of U.S. Bancorp. A few years ago he started a
bank in San Francisco on the side. His board membership extends from the financial (a Fortune 100 company) and educational (U.C.
Denver Business School) to community organizations (the chamber of commerce, the National Jewish Hospital and Research Center,
the Boy Scouts Council)—not to mention political service (chairing the transition team of Gov. Bill Ritter, Democrat of Colorado).
And museums, a priority among the board invitations he has accepted. He served on the Smithsonian Institution's national board for
six years and is now a trustee of the Denver Art Museum (DAM), where he established the Daniel Yohannes Family African Gallery. ""I
get a lot of my inspirations intellectually and culturally through art and history, primarily through museums,"" he says. ""So when I
was asked to sit on the [DAM] board, it was just a natural fit for me.""
For all his success, though, Yohannes hardly gives the impression of a Type-A personality. Courtly, soft-spoken, with a melodious
accent paying homage to his Ethiopian roots despite his decades in the U.S., he is generous and unhurried with his time in
interviews. On the phone, he asks how you are, what you've been up to lately; told that an interviewer just bought her first house,
he chats for a few moments about how delightful and meaningful that purchase is. In person, for a conversation at the AAM Annual
Meeting in Denver last spring, he walked into a rather dreary underground room in the convention center, suave in a conservative
navy suit and warm in his greetings, politely oblivious to the tables cluttered with the conference staff's walkie-talkies, office supplies
and assortment of snacks. The photographer got sent to the wrong room and his interviewer had to scurry the length of several
football fields to find her? No problem; he'd reserved plenty of time to talk. ""Take your time.""
And yet you can at times glimpse the calm determination of a man who gets things done and, moreover, fiAly expects to. Vicki
Sterling, the Denver Art Museum's assistant director, says that ""what was truly unique about working with [Yohannes] on the African
gallery was his ability to bring together people from outside the regular museum donor community and get them interested in the
Denver Art Museum."" When you ask him how he did this, who these new museophiles were, you can almost hear him shrug over the
phone. ""Friends of mine, people I knew,"" he says. ""They contributed because I asked them to."" He also shrugs off the question ofThe Uncommon Trustee

Many thanks for the Tiananmen statement, which hit all they key points, and went a long way towards resolving any lingering
ambiguity from the Secretary's February comments. We believe it remains crucial to make such statements every year-or until such
time as the Chinese government allows for real resolution. We know these statements cause a certain amoint of diplomatic rancor, but
we hope that the comfort and courage they give people also remain part of your calculations.
May I trouble one of you to forward this message to Steve and Dan in Beijing, and to Carlos in DC? And please do feel free to share it

By Jeff Zeleny
Updated President Obama on Saturday selected one of the nation's leading Republican governors to serve as
the ambassador to China, nominating Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman for the diplomatic post that Mr. Obama called
""as important as any in the world.""
""We will launch a new era of partnership between our two nations that will advance our shared dreams of
opportunity and security in America, in Asia and around the world,"" Mr. Obama said. ""I can think of no more
important assignment than creating the kinds of bridges between our two countries that will determine the well
being not just of Americans and Chinese, but also the future of the world.""
In a morning announcement at the White House, Mr. Huntsman stood at the president's side in the Diplomatic
Room and accepted the position that he said came as a surprise. As a co-chairman of Senator John McCain's
presidential campaign last year, Mr. Huntsman said he did not expect to be ""called into action by the person
who beat us.""
Mr. Huntsman, 49, learned to speak Mandarin Chinese from his days as a Mormon missionary in Taiwan. He
has worked in two Bush administrations, serving as the ambassador to Singapore in the final year of George
H.W. Bush's term and as a deputy United States trade ambassador for George W. Bush.
For Mr. Obama, whose advisers already have their eyes set on his re-election in 2012, the selection of Mr.
Huntsman is something of a political coup. He has emerged as one of the nation's most visible Republican
governors and was expected to at least consider seeking his party's presidential nomination to run against Mr.
Obama.
""In the breadth of issues at stake, this ambassadorship is as important as any in the world,"" Mr. Obama said. ""I
believe there is much to be gained from a closer working relationship with China, but improved relationships
will require candor on issues in which we don't always agree.""
As the Republican Party forges through a period of reinvention, Mr. Huntsman has been a leading voice for the
direction of the party. He has been a political moderate on issues like immigration, gay rights and the
environment, even though he represented one of the most conservative states in the country.Utah Governor to Become Ambassador to China

1840,2009-06-09T04:00:00+00:00,"FyiSecretary Clinton's remarks at her Friday press conference with the Turkish Foreign Minister continued this
Administration's excellent efforts to restore the credibility of the U.S. with Greece and Cyprus — which will lead to
important progress in the region.
As you know, the Bush Administration consistently hid and defended actions by Turkey that were injurious to Cyprus and
Greece, inconsistent with American values and principals, and also not in Turkey's best interests.
We highlighted for the top leaders in our community that Secretary Clinton once again in front of the Turkish Foreign
Minister, called for a ""bi-zonal and bi-communal federation"" for Cyprus as well as expressed the United States' strong
support for ""freedom of religion.""
With Secretary Clinton and others doing these kinds of things, America is moving to correct the biggest road block to a
Cyprus settlement — restoring American credibility with the Greek-Cypriots which was badly lost during the Bush
Administration.
Keep up the great work!

1. I've copied below texts of three articles you might not have seen. The first, by Juan Cole,
leading expert from University of Michigan on Iraq/Iran, lays out evidence so far on the
stolen election. Second, I've included the key graphs from Bill Keller's piece today in the
Times on same. And, third, Jane Mayer's article in the new issue of The New Yorker, out
tomorrow. (She sent me a digital copy.) The piece includes an interview with Panetta,
who himself discloses the internal administration debate—he was initially for a
commission but was overruled by Rabin and Axelrod.
2. On the Iranian election, the international press will obviously pursue the story of the
rigging of the vote, which will damage the legitimacy of regime. It's clear from reports
that even the Iranian man-on-the-street is affected by global public opinion and receives
international news through a wide variety of media. Ahmadinejad post-election continues
to ratchet up paranoia to consolidate support. After his statement and post-Bibi today,
there may be a remark to be made to address and defuse paranoia. If anything, whatever
the facts about the integrity of democracy in Iran, there is more reason than ever for all
sides to dispense with the politics of paranoia and discover that there are overriding
shared interests for peace, etc. But when to say anything depends upon how long to let
internal bitterness over the aftermath in Iran to simmer and the pressure from press for a
statement from you.
3. Jane Mayer's piece details the many moving and uncontrolled parts of the torture debate,
which has become chronic and will flare up again and again. The ""distraction"" will not go
away. I would avoid ever being drawn into commenting on any aspect.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

••■■•••mopick for Protocol Post Corrects Failure to File Taxes in 2
Years
By ALISON LEIGH COWAN
The New York Times
June 19,2009
President Obama's choice as chief of protocol for the State Department, a position that carries the
status of an ambassadorship, did not file tax returns for 2005 and 2006, errors she corrected last
November.
The nominee, Capricia Penavic Marshall, has placed blame for the problem on the Postal Service and
on miscommunication between her husband and their accountant.
Ms. Marshall, who was a social secretary in the Clinton White House, notified the Obama
administration about the late filings before she was nominated on May 14. She has since provided
written answers to questions about the matter from Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the top
Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, which will hold a hearing on the appointment next
Wednesday. The post requires Senate confirmation.
Tax issues have bedeviled several high-level Obama appointees and cost the administration at least
two of its picks.

Just to close the loop, I did meet w/ Jeffrey Romoff and his team on Wed
afternoon. They gave a very impressive into on what the University
Medical Center of Pittsburgh (UPMC) is doing in Southern Italy. They are
already getting a lot of political support from our Emb in Rome and are
grateful for it.
I gave them some practical suggestions on other levers in the USG that
they could pull (TDA, OPIC, Commerce Advocacy Center).
They want the Secretary will make some positive reference to Berlusconi in
Italy this summer of their interest in working the GOI to build a
lab/production facility for developing vaccines for H1N1 and other
infectious diseases. They also note the coincidence of the G20 mtng in
Pittsburgh later this summer. I made no commitment. But I do believe this
is a genuinely positive program and our Emb agrees.
I did pass their materials to David Thorne and urged him to be in
touch. He said he would engage, once/if he is confirmed.
StuI believe the UPMC's goal is to have some help with the Italians in achieving funding for a project in PA. But all the
background I know is below in my first email.Thanks Nora. I'm now in touch w/ Leslie and we'll work something out for

way to freedom after more than seven months of captivity in the mountains of Afghanistan
and Pakistan.
David Rohde, along with a local reporter, Tahir Ludin and their driver, Asadullah Mangal,
were abducted outside of Kabul on Nov. 10 while Mr. Rohde was researching a book.
Mr. Rohde was part of the Times reporting team that won a Pulitzer Prize in May for
coverage of Afghanistan and Pakistan last year.
Mr. Rohde told his wife, Kristen Mulvihill, that Mr. Ludin joined him late Friday night in
climbing over the wall of a compound where they were being held in the North Waziristan
region of Pakistan. They found a Pakistani army scout, who led them to a nearby army
base, and on Saturday they were flown to the American Bagram military base in
Afghanistan.
""They just walked over the wall of the compound,"" said Ms. Muvihill.
Mr. Mangal did not escape with the two other men.
The initial report was that Mr. Rohde was in good health, while Mr. Ludin injured his foot
in the escape.

Hope you are resting comfortably. Please take this as an excuse to get much needed rest. Lots of
people have expressed best wishes for you to me--Sean Wilentz, Joe Conason, Gene Lyons, etc--so
if they haven't contacted you because you're behind a wall you should know that many, many people
are thinking about you now.
I spoke this morning to Gary Sick, who, you recall, was senior person on NSC during the Iran hostage
crisis, and is now at Columbia. He has one of the best intelligence networks on Iran, 1,500 people,
experts with extensive contacts, and many Iranians, deeply embedded in the unfolding events
Gary tells me that Mousavi has evolved from a mild-mannered
reformer to directly challenging the regime. Nobody, he says, knows where this will go, certainly not
the Iranians. Khamenei has exposed himself and lost his aura of mystification, plunging into the arena
as a political player. Mousavi has issued a new revolutionary manifesto, just translated; I enclose
below Sick's report and analysis on it. This poses, Sick says, a new challenge to Khamenei. Does he
let it stand? Does he answer it? Sick also says US diplomacy in fact can't accomplish anything with
the regime until the crisis completely works its way out, which could take years. He points out that the
first mass demonstrations against the Shah occurred a full year before his overthrow. He adds that
the one thing the regime has learned fro m the Shah is not to be equivocal toward demonstrations.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr
1922,2009-06-22T04:00:00+00:00,"FYIDear Cheryl and Susan,
Below is a response from the American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors, the largest and most well-known Holocaust
survivor group in the United States, strongly opposing a letter to Secretary of State Clinton, which was simultaneously
sent to Haaretz in Israel, from a group of survivors based in South Florida, asking that I be replaced as head of the U.S.
delegation because of my association with the Jewish Claims Conference. I will separately send their initial letter.
I have talked with Ambassador Christian Kennedy about this scurrilous and unrepresentative attack, made just before the
Prague Conference is to begin. We agree it emanates from two related causes. First, it was instigated by Sam Dubbin, a
class action lawyer in Miami who has spent the better part of ten years trying to get Congress to overturn the agreements
I negotiated on behalf of the Clinton Administration, which obtained over $8 billion for Holocaust survivors and other
victims of Nazi persecution around the world. He wants to be free to sue the very companies who paid these sums, in
return for getting assurances of the U.S. government would do all it could to provide ""legal peace"" from future suits.
Several federal courts have upheld our agreements. He has lobbied for legislation last year and again this year. Indeed,
Chairman Frank held a hearing in 2008 on this matter.
The second basis of the letter is a long-standing dispute between some survivors against the Jewish Claims Conference,
based in New York City, which was officially designated in the 1950s by the governments of Germany and Israel to be the
negotiator with the German government on behalf of Jewish Holocaust survivors. The bulk of the $60 billion paid by the
German government since the 1950s in reparations is passed through the Claims Conference, which then distributes it to
survivors. Their complaints range from a lack of transparency in their operations to the 80%-20% split, by which 80% of
their proceeds go directly to survivors and 20% to various Jewish organizations for projects of remembrance and
education about the Holocaust.
My association with the Jewish Claims Conference, which was fully disclosed during my vetting, is very tangential. I
volunteered to lead their once a year negotiation with the German government to improve pensions for survivors, to
provide new services like home care, and to increased the population of survivors covered by the German government. I
have done this once, in March of this year, with, by the way, major breakthroughs for survivors. None of these issues is
involved in the Prague Conference, and the German government has no problem with my participation. That is the only
involvement I have with the Claims Conference. I do not participate in their governing bodies, and have no hand in their
allocation or other decisions. I will not be involved again, until their next negotiation, in 2010, unless I decide not to
continue my voluntary negotiation for them.
Moreover, the letter is unbelievably inaccurate. While I have only been involved for several weeks as the official head of
the delegation, it is grossly inaccurate for them to allege that survivors have been left out of the process. Ambassador
Kennedy has done remarkable outreach to the survivor community for many months, in preparation for the Prague
Conference, and survivors are well represented on the Delegation. In the period since I have been officially involved, I
have met with the German Insurance Association to see if they would make a contribution for the social needs of
survivors; have talked with Judah Gribetz, the Special Master for the Swiss bank settlement, to see if any of the extra
sums they will have left over can be given to survivors; have worked to get language in the Terezin Declaration to
encourage countries to set up special funds for survivors and to use heirless property to assist them.Dear Mr. Liphshiz,
With respect to your article yesterday on the utterly unwarranted personal attack on Ambassador Stuart
Eizenstat by a group of American Holocaust survivors, you should be aware that the leadership of the largest
organization of survivors and descendants of survivors in the United States, the American Gathering of Jewish
Holocaust Survivors and Their Descendants, in no way shares these sentiments. On the contrary, we hold
Ambassador Eizenstat in the highest esteem, know him to be a man of the highest integrity and ethical
standards, and are deeply grateful to him for everything he has done and continues to do on behalf of the
survivors over many years.
Neither David Schaecter nor Leo Rechter speak for anyone other than the groups they represent, and Mr.
Rechter's statement that survivors have ""no confidence"" in Ambassador Eizenstat is, viewed most charitably, a
gross overstatement in that he seeks to attribute his personal prejudices to the many thousands of survivors who
do not share his views and who have never authorized him to speak in their name. The lives of thousands upon
thousands of survivors throughout the world have been made easier over the past 15 years thanks to
Ambassador Eizenstat's tireless work on their behalf. I cannot think of anyone more appropriate to head the
U.S. delegation to the Prague conference.
The fact is that Ambassador Eizenstat's only association with the Claims Conference is a once a year, three day
negotiation as a volunteer with the German government for the interests of the survivors. The first such
negotiation took place earlier this year in March and resulted in 13,000 survivors who had previously been
turned down becoming eligible for for reparations for the first time, and in the improvement in existing pension
payments to survivors totaling over $50 million. Moreover, the specific pension issues for which he
volunteered to negotiate with the German government bear no relationship to the issues being covered by the
Prague Conference.
During the Clinton Administration, Ambassador Eizenstat was the Special Representative of the President and
Secretary of State on Holocaust era issues and the lead negotiator on such issues with the Swiss, German,
Austrian and French governments, as well as with various Eastern and Central European governments. In that
capacity, he obtained over $8 billion dollars in compensation and restitution for Holocaust survivors, including
payments to slave and forced laborers, the return of thousands of Jewish communal and private properties, the
payments of tens of thousands of previously undisclosed bank accounts, the recovery of hundreds of pieces of
looted art, and the payments on thousands of insurance policies. Indeed, Ambassador Eizenstat is more
responsible than any other single person for placing the issue of justice for Holocaust survivors on the
international agenda more than half a century after the end of World War II. He has also headed the U.S.
delegations to every one of the four previous international conferences dealing with Holocaust era assets,
beginning with the 1997 London Conference on Nazi Gold. Messrs. Schaecter and Rechter are well aware of
all this, and the fact that they chose to engage in an ad hominem attack against Ambassador Eizenstat one week
before the opening of the Prague conference - his appointment as head of the U.S. delegation was publicly
announced weeks ago - is unseemly and disingenuous in the extreme.

there is a dispute over exactly what time he will speak.
*It was a healthy, helpful conversation,. Shelton said of the meeting.
Shelton and Bond said they did not see Obama while they were in the West Wing for roughly 45 minutes.

There has been so much news of death and destruction from Iraq that the position of sexual minorities is rarely

Release Detail
July 7, 2009 - Obama's Approval Drops In Ohio - Critical Swing State, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds;
2010 Senate Race Tips Slightly To Democrats
Word format
President Barack Obama gets a lackluster 49 - 44 percent approval rating in Ohio, considered by many to be the
most important swing state in a presidential election, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today.
This is President Obama's lowest approval rating in any national or statewide Quinnipiac University poll since
he was inaugurated and is down from 62 - 31 percent in a May 6 survey.
By a small 48 - 46 percen t margin, voters disapprove of the way Obama is handling the economy, the
independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University poll finds. This is down from a 57 - 36 percent approval
May 6. A total of 66 percent of Ohio voters are ""somewhat dissatisfied"" or ""very dissatisfied"" with the way
things are going in the state, while 33 percent are ""very satisfied"" or ""somewhat satisfied,"" numbers that haven't
changed since Obama was elected.
In the race for Ohio's U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring George Voinovich in 2010, Lee Fisher and
Jennifer Brunner remain neck-and-neck for the Democratic nomination and both would defeat any of the GOP
candidates if the election were today.
""The economy in Ohio is as bad as anywhere in America. These numbers indicate that for the first time voters
have decided that President Barack Obama bears some responsibility for their problems,"" said Peter A. Brown,
assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.
""Until now voters have given President Obama high ratings on the economy, blaming former President George
W. Bush for their problems. They might be taking out their frustration on President Obama, possibly deciding
that the change he promised has not come as quickly as they expected.""
""Ohio historically has been the prototypical swing state. One of the reasons Barack Obama won the p residency
by such a wide margin is that he carried Ohio with 52 percent of the vote and captured the lion's share of
independent votes,"" Brown added.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

farmers currently working in Africa! That's remarkable if you think about it. China has also bought nearly 3
million hectares of land in Africa and could become one of the largest sources of commercial farming on the
continent. They are also building many of the roads that will transform transportation and the movement of
agriculture products.

their proposal as well as the content and the overall approach. They are even privately questioning the
relationship. (This hasn't affected their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts.
At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the United
States delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent communications.
While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation on specific
elements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific issues, the Palau
delegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United States delegation did not
seriously respond, as required by the Compact, to the operational requirements of the Government of Palau or to Palau's
comprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-sufficiency.
In light of the foregoing, the Palau delegation has determined that it must now return to Palau to discuss with President Toribiong
the next steps that Palau needs to take regarding the Compact. Thank you.

Thanks,

Dear Cheryl,
Congratulations on the launch of the $20b G8 initiative. This will stand as a historic success of President Obama and
Secretary Clinton. Please do convey my personal congratulations and gratitude to Secretary Clinton if you have a
moment to do so. I know what a key role you personally played in bringing this to fruition.
I would like to suggest one overarching strategy for success.
Please do push hard on the donors (USAID included!) to pool the donor resources into one, at most two, multilateral
funding streams. Certainly the World Bank should be the main spigot, and IFAD possibly a second. By pooling the
resources, we'll cut down BY YEARS on the delays, donor negotiations, further talk, report writing, expert trips, etc., etc.,
which are now the biggest single threat to success of the initiative.
I look forward to a few minutes by phone or in person to offer some tips coming from long years of experience in this
sphere. This can be a real historic path-breaker, if it's not swallowed in the agencies!
Warm regards and kudos!

By Edward Schumacher-Matos
Sunday, July 12, 2009
Sometimes you have to give political leaders credit.
President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are on the verge of achieving their own coup in
Honduras and advancing American interests with a deftness not seen from Washington in many years.
The president's reference to Honduras during his trip to Moscow reflects how the small Central American
country is but a pawn as the administration pushes the reset button globally and in the hemisphere.
Justice may not be totally served in Honduras, but the country is likely to end up better off anyway.
""America cannot and should not seek to impose any system of government on any other country,"" Obama said
in Russia, ""nor would we presume to choose which party or individual should run a country. . . . Even as we
meet here today, America supports now the restoration of the democratically elected president of Honduras,
even though he has strongly opposed American policies. We do so not because we agree with him. We do so
because we respect the universal principle that people should choose their own leaders.""",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Jim and torn F comments in email below.
Cdmi like virtually everything in the two-pager, and I do agree with Tom on the notion of elevating the ""national
interest"" and security elements of this, both because those have become part of her ""brand,"" and also to help
flesh it out in a way that both gives it the widest reach, and also protects it from attack.
some ways to consider doing that might be to just ensure that the overarching description of it ""call out"" the
national interest/security reasoning at work - something like ""America has the opportunity and the responsibility
to lead in the creation of a network of principled partnerships that will serve our national interest, enhance our
security and build the capacity of people and nations to solve global problems and give everyone more power to
reach their potential.""
(i inserted ""network"" of principled partnerships because i think it kind of alludes to both the diversity of the
kinds of partnerships as well as to the influence of technology on building them...not a ""must have"" but just a
thought... .in the same vein, i don't know whether there might be an advantage in alluding to a network of
""pragmatic and principled partnerships"" or ""practical and principled partnerships"" just to ensure it's got that
pragmatism aspect of it sharply inserted).See attached
11I tried out ""principled partnership"" on her this morning and she likes it — I really think we're almost there. Pse
let me know whether I can distribute this more widely for tomorrow's mtg.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

I just spoke with Marie Damour, CG at Embassy Brasilia, who provided an update on the Goldman case.
A scheduled 1100 EST press conference by the attorney for the Brazilian family did not take place. Damour reports the
attorneys from both sides are still negotiating the details of the handover, as is the attorney for the Government of
Brasil. According to the 2nd Regional Federal Court, the deadline for the turnover at the Consulate falls at 0600 local on
12/24. However, there may be a push to turn Sean over to the consulate today in order to permit him to travel to the
U.S. on an overnight flight.Dan,
I just got off the phone with Embassy Brasilia Charge Lisa Kubiske, who provided a recap of current developments in theMs. Damour,
Do you have any updated information to report? As you could imagine, there is significant high-level interest in the
Department on the Goldman case, and I am hoping to brief the Executive Secretary with the latest developments at
0745 EST.
Thanks.
Gregory Macris
Senior Watch OfficerImportance: HighGiven the hour here, I am less optimistic that we will pull off a return tonight, but we are still working to that end.
The Brazilian Central Authority confirms that the office of Regional Federal Court President Paulo Espirito Santo
has received the decision of STF President Gilmar Mendes. It is Paulo E-S who will be responsible for enforcing the
decision from Mendes, i.e. the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S.
BCA has promised to reinforce for Interpol the urgent necessity of police in Rio monitoring the location of Sean
Goldman. Embassy LEGAT office is double-tracking. We cannot, of course, ask them to enforce anything until the
proper judicial authority has sent them instructions, but we strongly urge them to be prepared.
BCA has turned over operational jurisdiction to Daniel Levy, from the AGU's office in Rio, to coordinate with David
Goldman's attorney and with the court in Rio. I have asked David's attorney to try and get some understanding from
Mr. Levy as to the timeline we can expect to see in this case.PLEASE NOTE — I am aware of the intense interest back in DC about this case and will be passing information just as soon
as I receive it. This means that in most cases, I will not be able to confirm the information. Will try to identify credible
sources vice what rumor/press/others are saying.
Brazilian Central Authority (BCA) coordinating with David's attorney and the Federal attorneys in Rio to ensure that the
President of the Regional Federal Court in Rio has a copy of the STF order and is submitting the official request to federal
police to enforce. BCA says they still believe they can effect the turnover tonight and are at their office working to that
end. If/when the Federal Police enforce, their stated preference is to go to the airport and effect the handover there.
This is a scenario we've planned for.
BCA has mentioned the STJ motions filed by the Brazilian family as a potential obstacle, but thru their contacts in
Mendes' office at STF, have heard that Mendes intends to reach out to the reporting judge at STJ to resolve that issue.
As mentioned in an earlier update today, we have not had any confirmation that the STJ judge has accepted to hear the
motions filed by the Brazilian family, and has the option to decline to hear them.UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762853 Date: 06/30/2015Marie, if there is a handover tonight: that would be at the Consulate in Rio, right? Grandparents would bring Sean and
he'd spend the night...in David's hotel or at the Consulate?
It seems very, very unlikely that will happen tonight.
But if handover is delayed until morning, the family may try to slip away tonight. Can we ask the police to prevent that?Importance: High",huma.abedin@univ-tlse3.fr

will be getting new numbers in the next round of negotiations. I will stay on top of it, though no matter what I don't
think they will be 100 percent satisfied.Jake---Pls review, do some recon outreach and advise what, if anything, we should do. Thx. HBelow is the statement of very impressive Palau reps at the end of a session of required meetings on the next phase of
free association aid. FYI only, the Palauans were insulted by the nature and depth of the response to their proposal as
well as the content and the overall approach. They are even privately questioning the relationship. (This hasn't affected
their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts.
At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the
United States delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent
communications.
While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation
on specific elements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific
issues, the Palau delegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United
States delegation did not seriously respond, as required by the Compact, to the operational requirements of the
Government of Palau or to Palau's comprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-
sufficiency.
In light of the foregoing, the Palau delegation has determined that it must now return to Palau to discuss with President
Toribiong the next steps that Palau needs to take regarding the Compact. Thank you.

find a helpful solution.
Amorim called the Brazilian Ambassador here, who tom spoke to after your call. Amorim was very happy with the call,
especially the detailed discussion of possible solutions. He professed a desire to work with you to resolve this issue.
Brazil recognizes that it is being tagged as the ""blocker on democratic language and wants to get out of the way. That
explains Amorim's heavy push to give this issue back to Insulza. Torn told the Brazilian Ambassador that Insulza has a big
credibility problem in our Congress, and that we, Brazil, Mexico, and others cannot walk away from the issue. This was
being relayed back to Amorim.

2223,2009-06-28T04:00:00+00:00,"Update from tomI am in the office and working with our Embassy in Tegucigalpa. Apparently, the action this morning was a coordinated
effort by the Supreme Court, the Honduran Congress, and the armed forces to prevent President Zelaya from holding a
non-binding poll on a possible constituent assembly. The Supreme Court determined the poll illegal and ordered the
military to collect all balloting materials. In the process of doing this, the military also seized Zelaya and supposedly sent
him by aircraft to Costa Rica.
Our Ambassador has his Emergency Action Committee convened at the Embassy. They are reaching out to all their
contacts to determine the current state of play. The Embassy will issue a warden message soon to U.S. citizens in
Honduras regarding events. I have called our Embassy in Costa Rica and asked it to confirm Zelaya's presence in San
Jose. I will be calling the Costa Rican Foreign Minister soon. Tomorrow, Costa Rica takes over as President Pro Temp of
the Central American Integration System.
Hector Morales has been in touch with OAS SecGen Insulza. The OAS Permanent Council passed a resolution on Friday
offering its good offices to Honduras to resolve the political impasse, and Insulza was going to lead a team to Honduras
on Monday. We are checking to determine the state of play of the delegation, but OAS involvement will be key to a
successful resolution of this event.

B6Mills, Cheryl D;
It's 8 hours 45 minutes to Orlando.WHEELS UP for the Goldman plane.Importance: High
Sean and David Goldman have left the consulate for the airport. Wheels up likely in one hour or less.
SBU
This email is UNCLASSIFIED.Sean has not yet arrived at the consulate.
David Goldman, Rep Smith, David's attorneys and Mission personnel all safe at Consulate. Still set for 9am handover.
Consulate will allow Sergio Tostes, attorney for the Brazilian family, into the building along with Sean and his
grandmother, Silvana. We have arranged for the party to enter directly into the building via the garage. The
grandmother announced to the press her intention to ""park 3 blocks away, as the consulate would not allow her in"" but
press are quoting the Embassy spokesperson Orna Blum flatly contradicting that statement, emphasizing that for Sean's
emotional well-being, and in sensitivity to Silvana and David, the reunion be safe, private, and calm.Importance: High
It appears there will be no handover tonight. According to David's Brazilian attorney, the negotiators have broken
up, having not been able to agree on the issue of the Grandmother accompanying Sean to the U.S. on the plane (clearly,
the other side remains unaware of the source/nature of the charter flight that is pending a handover). We have
rebuffed attempts by the Brazilian family's attorney to ""get clarification from the Americans"" as an obvious last-ditch
ploy to once again present this as a U.S. vs Brazil issue. We have been clear to all parties that we the Mission have
absolutely no role in any negotiation between the parties and will not/not undertake any contact with the family or their
representatives.
Deadline for handover established by the President of the 2nd Regional Federal Court in Rio remains 9am Thursday
•
morning at the U.S. Consulate. Brazilian Central Authority confirms that the warrant authorizing enforcement of the
order has been issued and should be in the possession of law enforcement should the family not comply. BCA has
confirmed they will be in early tomorrow morning, ready to arrange enforcement should that be necessary. However,
David's attorney believes they will comply with the order and appear at the Consulate. We stand ready for multiple
scenarios.
In good news, the Brazilian Central Authority reported that the judge assigned to hear the two motions filed by
attorneys for the Brazilian family in the Superior Tribunal de Justica (STJ) has denied both motions on the merits, not just
refused to consider the motions. Links to the decisions for those who wish to read legal Portuguese are provided below.
The frequently-announced press conference by the Brazilian family/their attorney never materialized. We await
word on their next public relations foray.Importance: High
I have just spoken with the Brazilian Central Authority regarding the orders imminently coming out of the office of the
President of the 2nd Regional Federal Court. He is evidently interpreting the lifting of the stay imposed at STF to mean
that the 48 hour period provided in the appellate court decision to the Brazilian family to turn over Sean to the
Consulate has started ticking again — not restarted at the beginning, but resumed ticking. According to the Court, the
deadline for turnover at the Consulate falls at 6am local time on Thursday morning, December 24. Because of the early
hour, he will evidently order the family to turn over Sean at the consulate NO LATER than 9am on Thursday, December
24. However, he will also recommend, not order, that the family turn over Sean at the Consulate today/tonight in order
to permit him to travel to the U.S. on an overnight flight and spend Christmas with the family in the U.S.
There is current debate ongoing regarding the timing of the turnover. Daniel Levy of the AGU office in Rio will evidently
take the lead in negotiating that turnover, in conjunction with David's legal team.
Press contacts are stating that Sergio Tostes, the attorney for the Brazilian family, has called a press conference at 2pm
local time (11am DC time) to announce voluntary turnover. No further details on that yet.Importance: HighImportance: HighGiven the hour here, I am less optimistic that we will pull off a return tonight, but we are still working to that end.
The Brazilian Central Authority confirms that the office of Regional Federal Court President Paulo Espirito Santo
has received the decision of STF President Gilmar Mendes. It is Paulo E-S who will be responsible for enforcing the
decision from Mendes, i.e. the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S.
• BCA has promised to reinforce for Interpol the urgent necessity of police in Rio monitoring the location of Sean
Goldman. Embassy LEGAT office is double-tracking. We cannot, of course, ask them to enforce anything until the
proper judicial authority has sent them instructions, but we strongly urge them to be prepared.
BCA has turned over operational jurisdiction to Daniel Levy, from the AGU's office in Rio, to coordinate with David
Goldman's attorney and with the court in Rio. I have asked David's attorney to try and get some understanding from
Mr. Levy as to the timeline we can expect to see in this case.PLEASE NOTE — I am aware of the intense interest back in DC about this case and will be passing information just as soon
as I receive it. This means that in most cases, I will not be able to confirm the information. Will try to identify credible
sources vice what rumor/press/others are saying.
Brazilian Central Authority (BCA) coordinating with David's attorney and the Federal attorneys in Rio to ensure that the
President of the Regional Federal Court in Rio has a copy of the STF order and is submitting the official request to federal
police to enforce. BCA says they still believe they can effect the turnover tonight and are at their office working to that
end. If/when the Federal Police enforce, their stated preference is to go to the airport and effect the handover there.
This is a scenario we've planned for.
BCA has mentioned the STJ motions filed by the Brazilian family as a potential obstacle, but thru their contacts in
Mendes' office at STF, have heard that Mendes intends to reach out to the reporting judge at STJ to resolve that issue.
As mentioned in an earlier update today, we have not had any confirmation that the STJ judge has accepted to hear the
motions filed by the Brazilian family, and has the option to decline to hear them.If the family sees the writing on the wall (frankly unlikely at this point) and agrees to abide by the order of immediate
return, then in theory the handover would happen at the consulate and there is a plan in place for that.
Plans in motion to prevent them slipping away and Patricia Lamego is working with the police as we speak. Federal
Police repeatedly assured us they were prepped and ready to move but could take no action absent an order. They
know now there is one, so BCA will get them moving.
If the handover occurred tonight, I'm told we need 3 hours to get the plane off the ground, so overnight in the hotel.Marie, if there is a handover tonight: that would be at the Consulate in Rio, right? Grandparents would bring Sean and
he'd spend the night...in David's hotel or at the Consulate?
It seems very, very unlikely that will happen tonight.
But if handover is delayed until morning, the family may try to slip away tonight. Can we ask the police to prevent that?Importance: High",huma.abedin@univ-tlse3.fr abedinh©state.gov@univ-tlse3.fr

In addition to the in fee generated revenue, we have an additional in new money and they are
providing an additional directly to Treasury for the multilateral food initiative. This means that of the
that you discussed with the President, the budget will reflect77of new resources in State and
n Treasury). The one condition on the top line is that the State/USAID percentage increase cannot be
greater than Defense — which is now 3 percent, which is why part of the multilateral food assistance funding is going
directly to Treasury. As they work through the details of the numbers, this is the one place that we could face a last
minute issue if the percentages get out of alignment.
In terms of policy this has all of the restorations to initiatives that we discussed last week and also adds to
MCC (OMB made this part of the agreement). In food security, with the combination of from State/USAID
and in new money will add to the multilateral initiative; we will fund the nutrition component
within the State/USAID levels. Global engagement will be funded at of new money and we will be able to
restore the proposal to increase in State and USAID staffing. While the staff increases will be funded at 50 percent of
the originally proposed levels, with carryover balances because prior year appropriations were delayed there will be a
very strong continuation of new recruitment. It should feel like we are on track and will add much needed capacity —
much better than a pause.
While we still have a risk that the fee proposal may,not be accepted, we now have of cushion in new State
ops funding which means our absolute risk vs. current levels is only . We also get the upside that any
additional fee revenues above projections will come to State and the permanent transfer of revenues, if enacted, will
provide long term stability in State ops funding.

still thinking about weighing in on the need for full funding. I told him that we expect funding levels that will permit us",jacob.lew@univ-tlse3.fr lewjjstate.gov.@univ-tlse3.fr

2319,2009-08-02T04:00:00+00:00,"JERUSALEM, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Israeli police recommended on Sunday that state prosecutors charge
Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman for bribery, fraud and money laundering. Lieberman, whose
ultranationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party is a key partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling coalition,
accused police of waging a ""campaign of persecution"" against him and said their allegations were
unfounded. In a statement, police said a nine-year investigation found ""a basis of evidence"" against Lieberman
of bribe-taking, fraud, violation of public confidence and obstruction of justice with regard to suspected money
laundering. The investigation, conducted mostly while Lieberman held other government posts, focused on the
transfer of millions of Israeli shekels to shell companies and accounts belonging to people close to him, the
statement said. Lieberman, in a statement released by his spokesman, said there was ""no basis for the police
recommendation"" and expressed confidence he would not be indicted. Police handed their recommendation to
state prosecutors who have to decide whether to charge Lieberman, the latest in a line of Israeli public figures to
face police questioning. Ehud Olmert was forced to resign as prime minister a year ago over a corruption
probe, though he has denied any wrongdoing. The Moldavan-born Lieberman has been denounced by Israeli
Arabs as a racist for his party's introduction of legislation to curb the liberties of citizens deemed as disloyal to
the state, moves widely seen as targeting Israel's Arab minority.

you talk about Israel and Palestine and about Iraq and Afghanistan - it seems to me that those are tactical
discussions of an existing issue, and somewhat removed from the more abstract and strategic policy outline
she's otherwise aiming at here.
By the way, the phrase ""global network of diverse partnerships"" seems to be absent now. I kind of liked it on
several levels, but I presume it met some objection along the way...217",huma.abedin@univ-tlse3.fr hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

White House Counsel's Job at Stake
By BY EVAN PEREZ
WASHINGTON Obama administration officials are holding discussions that could result in White House
counsel Gregory Craig leaving his post, following a rocky tenure, people familiar with the matter said.
Mr. Craig, the top lawyer at the White House and a close aide to President Barack Obama, has helped lead the
administration's efforts on several national-security issues that once enjoyed popularity but have since become
become political liabilities for Mr. Obama.
View Full Image
President Barack Obama meets with White House counsel Gregory Craig, right, in the Oval Office in June.
These include the closure of the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the release of Bush administration-era
national-security documents, and efforts to find legal ways to indefinitely hold some detainees who can't be put
on trial.
The decision to close the Guantanamo facility became a political problem for Mr. Obama when concerns arose
that some of the detainees would be released into the U.S. and the public soured on the move.
Mr. Craig didn't respond to questions about his job as White House counsel for this article.
The people familiar with the matter said a final decision hasn't been made.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

revenue on diplomatic residences.
Jack said he would be glad to
call Schumer about this, and would like to intervene before this becomes a public dispute.
Merida Initiative
• Both Jack and Jim voiced misgivings over the current state of the Merida Initiative report needed for the release
of the last 15 percent of the allocated resources. Jim noted that, in effect, this is a certification. He said that
there is still insufficient transparency on the part of the Mexicans and that it is unclear that their proposal to try
alleged military human rights violations in military courts covers the full range of potential transgressions. Jim
said he would have a meeting later this morning to review with WHA, INL, H and others what needed to be
added, but the goal is to turn it around as quickly as possible and ensure that we do not lose out on the 15
percent.
Somalia
• Jack said that he had looked at the draft OFAC letter on humanitarian assistance to Somalia and thought it went
about as far as possible in addressing the concerns of USAID, short of granting a license in advance for any
actions that might inadvertently provide material support to terrorist groups. In essence, the OFAC letter tells
AID that they do not need authorization to proceed as they plan. The concern is that USAID may not be fully
satisfied and may try to re-litigate the issue. L was going to join AID in a meeting later today to discuss and
would seek to persuade them to accept the answer they had received from OFAC.
Colombia
• Jim voiced his displeasure over a cable from WHA on the proposed U.S.-Colombia Defense Cooperation
Agreement. I can provide you more details on the high side if you want, but in essence he noted that the policy
has not been fully thought out and that there needs to be a full policy review before we provide such guidance

North Korea frees detained South Korea worker
By KWANG-TAE KIM (AP) – 2 hours ago
SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has freed a South Korean worker detained for months in the communist country,
officials said Thursday, brightening prospects for improved relations on the peninsula.
The release came days after Hyundai Group Chairwoman Hyun Jung-eun traveled to Pyongyang in an effort to secure the
employee's freedom, and a week after the isolated regime freed two U.S. journalists sentenced to 12 years of hard labor
for entering the North illegally in March. That release followed a surprise visit by former President Bill Clinton, who held
talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong II.
The 44-year-old technician, surnamed Yoo, worked at an industrial zone in the North's border city of Kaesong, where
about 110 South Korean-run factories employ about 40,000 North Korean workers. He was detained in March for
allegedly denouncing the North's political system.
Though one of the few joint projects still running, the complex's viability has come under questions in recent months as
the North refused to release Yoo and demanded a massive increase in payments and recent at the industrial park. It now
has only a skeletal South Korean staff.
Unification Ministry spokeswoman Lee Jong-joo said Yoo — an employee of the Hyundai Group's North Korean business
arm, Hyundai Asan — had been released and was expected to return to South Korea later Thursday.
""It's fortunate that Yoo is returning to his family, though it's rather late,"" presidential spokesman Lee Dong-kwan said in
a statement. He added that the South Korean government will maintain a ""consistent policy"" toward North Korea.

has only a skeletal South Korean staff.
Unification Ministry spokeswoman Lee Jong-joo said Yoo — an employee of the Hyundai Group's North Korean business
arm, Hyundai Asan — had been released and was expected to return to South Korea later Thursday.
""It's fortunate that Yoo is returning to his family, though it's rather late,"" presidential spokesman Lee Dong-kwan said in
a statement. He added that the South Korean government will maintain a ""consistent policy"" toward North Korea.

Baker, Joshua N
We have had a brief but productive time here in Libya. Our visit here, inconceivable just a few
years ago, is another indication of the remarkable transformation of relations between our two
countries.
During our visit, we met with the National Security Advisor, with Col. Qadafi, and with a
number of advisors to the leader. We expressed our appreciation for Libya's decision to give up
its weapons of mass destruction programs and become a partner in the fight against violent
Islamic extremism, and discussed the ways in which relations between our countries can
continue on a positive and productive path. In particular, we discussed the possibility of
moving ahead with the provision of non-lethal defense equipment to the government of Libya.
As we move ahead with the many ways in which the United States and Libya can work closely
as partners, there remain areas where there remains real work to be done. The status of human
rights and political reform in Libya will remain a chief element of concern. In addition, we
understand that no final decision has been reached regarding the potential release from Scottish
prison of Abdel Basset al Megrahi, the man convicted of involvement in the bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103. Nevertheless, we made clear in our meetings with Libyan officials that we are
resolutely opposed to his release.
We encouraged our Libyan interlocutors to handle this case — which, after all, involves an
individual convicted of killing American citizens — in a fashion that will strengthen the growing
ties of friendship between our two countries, rather than hinder its progress.
We discussed these and other issues in a spirit of mutual respect and friendship. The ties
between the United States and Libya have taken a remarkable and positive turn in recent years,",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

John Yettaw was sentenced today to 7 years in prison (3 years for his immigration violation; 3 years for violating Burma's

We spent about 90 minutes with the four de facto representatives. I invited them to make their points first
(they often complain that people don't listen to them). They focused on the abuses Zelaya committed before
June 28, pointing out that the San Jose Accord, while'key to a solution, would not restore the institutional
damage done to Honduras.
I said that clearly the San Jose Accords were necessary but not sufficient to clean up all the broken crockery in
Honduras. But they ARE necessary — and urgent. Only by implementing the agreement can Hondurans repair
the other damage with the support of the international community — which is essential for the country's
success. I then reviewed all the carrots and sticks we discussed this morning. I cited the Secretary in
underscoring urgency. Other countries join us, I emphasized, in seeing the mixed messages coming out of
Tegucigalpa as a deliberate delaying tactic designed to move the country toward elections without
Zelaya. The United States and others are losing patience with these tactics and want to see solid commitment
to the Accord now.
The de factos acknowledged that the world perceives them as delaying and that they need to move quickly. I
said they should commit publicly to the San Jose Accord when the OAS FMs are in Honduras next week. They
said that made sense.
Then they brought up another issue. The San Jose Accord grants political amnesty but not amnesty for other
crimes. They can arrest Z for corruption as soon as he returns to the country. I pushed back hard, saying no
one — Arias, the OAS, the United States — understands the San Jose Accord as leading to Z's immediate
arrest. The understanding is that he would resume limited functions with a national unity cabinet until he
hands over power to an elected successor. To say they will arrest Z is to ensure that he does not return, and
thus the collapse of the Arias plan. They seemed to back off slightly, but this remains a problem.
We are working already with other FMs and with Arias to make sure the de factos know this is a non-starter. I
plan to call the de facto delegation chief back Wednesday to cite my conversations tonight with others in the
region and urge him again to talk to Arias directly about this.
Meanwhile, we are pocketing their promise to agree asap to the San Jose Accord.

2472,2009-07-21T04:00:00+00:00,"Below is Palau's statement on the recent meeting in the required free association review. The fourth is the key
paragraph. Jake, I'll call. Jeff 202-343-2905 o,
A Compact of Free Association replaced the United States administration of Palau, islands which the U.S. took in war and
subsequently administered for the United Nations. The Compact, which was signed in 1986 and took effect October 1,
1994, includes provisions of various duration. Some are to last at least 50 years, including full U.S. military authority --
although the power of the U.S. to deny access to Palau and its extensive waters by the military of any other nation is to
continue in perpetuity.
The amounts and types of U.S. budgetary and programmatic assistance to Palau under the Compact are specified for 15
years, but the Compact requires reviews of its terms and the entire relationship on its 15th, 30th, and
40th anniversaries. The reviews are to consider the operating requirements of the Government of Palau and the islands'
development. The Compact also commits the U.S. to acting on the findings and to promoting Palau's long-term economic
development.
A Palauan delegation that included Vice President Kerai Mariur, Chief Representative for Compact Review Joshua
Koshiba, Minister of Health Dr. Stevenson J. Kuartei, Palau Community College President Dr. Patrick Tellei, Ambassador
to the U.S. Hersey Kyota, Representative to the United Nations Stuart Beck, and their consultants met in Honolulu on July
8-9 in connection with the 15th Anniversary Review with an American delegation that included Department of State Office
of Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific Islands Affairs Alcy Frelick, the head of the US Delegation, and representatives of
the Departments of the Interior and Defense and the Weather and Postal Services.
The U.S. delegation made positive statements on a few matters and agreed to discuss some others further. A number of
the U.S. delegation's statements, however, evidenced a need for greater study by some U.S. officials of the intent as well
as the letter of the Compact, the relationship as a whole, Palau's economic situation and fiscal responsibility
commitments, and Palau's contributions to the U.S. and to international harmony -- including sacrifice by Palauans in the
U.S. military, the UN international peacekeeping force and Palau's strategic location and posture, and Palau's positions in
the U.N.
Palau is grateful for its partnership with the U.S. and wants to continue in the association as called for by the Compact,
deepen the relationship, and develop its capacities as a freely associated state. It appreciates the more positive
expressions of U.S. Secretaries of State Clinton and of the Interior Salazar and congressional leaders of both political
parties. Palau fully trusts that reflection will result in an approach to the relationship consistent with the Compact and to
positions befitting the great nation that is the United States.
Recognizing that the questions of the association are relatively small and unique for the Government of the U.S. and that
the U.S. faces many and extraordinary challenges at this time, Palau understands why more deliberation by U.S. officials
can be needed.
Because of this, because of the confidence that it has in the United States, and because it would not be productive to
elaborate with others on the conversations at this stage, Palau's representatives are confining additional comment to
official communications.

LONDON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - A decision by the Scottish government whether to release a Libyan convicted of the 1988
Lockerbie bombing may be announced as early as Thursday, a legislator said on Wednesday. Christine Grahame, a
member of the Scottish Parliament who has campaigned against the conviction, said she expected former Libyan
intelligence agent Abdel Basset al-Megrahi to be freed early on compassionate grounds because he has terminal
cancer. The regional administration has come under pressure from the United States to keep Megrahi in jail, while a
British government minister said the wait for news was ""becoming embarrassing"". ""I don't think it will be long coming,""
Grahame told BBC radio. ""I suspect we might have something maybe tomorrow (Thursday) morning. We will probably go
for compassionate release. It avoids a lot of difficulties."" Scotland's Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill is considering two
requests from Megrahi to be released early, on compassionate grounds or under a prisoner transfer agreement (PTA)

country's former military ruler, Pervez Musharraf. Pakistan's Supreme Court recently ruled that Musharraf's imposition
of a state of emergency in 2007 was unconstitutional a decision that raised the possibility he could be accused of
treason. But Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani had said such charges would only be brought against Musharraf if
Parliament passed a unanimous resolution requesting them. Speaking in Parliament on Wednesday night, Gilani said the
opposition parties did not have enough votes to pass the resolution indicating his own party would not vote in favor.

Secretary Clinton —
I understand you are going to Kenya next week and while I know the trip is primarily focused on trade issues, I
wanted to flag an issue for you because I know it is near and dear to your heart.
Kenya has one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in Africa — it is illegal unless a woman's life is at risk and
criminalizes both the woman and the provider. Two years ago, Kenyan authorities imprisoned a doctor and
two nurses, falsely accusing them of providing illegal abortions. After a year in prison, the providers were
found innocent and released, but it galvanized the legal and provider community who formed a coalition to
make abortion less restrictive. It will come as no surprise to you that, as a result of their abortion law, Kenya
has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in all of Africa, with an estimated 800 women a day seeking
the procedure, often through dangerous means.
Kenya is restarting a long-stalled constitutional review process and they hope to produce a final Constitution
by next year. Religious groups are on a concerted crusade to include new language in the Constitution which
would codify that ""life begins at conception"". The current Constitution is largely silent on the issue. If this fetal
personhood amendment goes forward, it would place Kenya in the small community of nations with such a
provision. It would clearly mark Kenya as out of stop with countries attempting to institutionalize the African
Union's Maputo Protocol, one of the most progressive regional documents on women, development and
reproductive rights, and with the vast majority of African countries in general. For a country trying to regain
the momentum of stability and success it enjoyed until recently, such a policy imposition would be a
regression for women's rights and for the country writ large.
I went to Kenya last month to work with the coalition that has formed to strategize against the Constitutional
amendment and to work toward a less restrictive abortion law. I also visited several of our clinics and
providers in Nairobi and in nearby villages where Planned Parenthood has programs to train providers in post
abortion care. You have seen this a million times in your travels around the world, so I don't need to tell you
how poignant the stories were of the lives saved and lost, the bravery in standing up to constant government
harassment, and the fear of what this potential Constitutional amendment will mean to the provision of safe
medical services. I know it is asking a lot, but if there is any way that you could draw attention to this issue
when you are in Kenya, you would be even more of my personal hero than you already are. It is our hope that
if Kenya knows the world is watching they may be more careful in how they proceed. Of course we would be
happy to help you in any way if you decide you want to do something on this while you are there. There is also
a Congressional delegation going to Kenya the week of August 8th and we are working on them to have a side
meeting on this issue as well.

An Open Hand That Weakens Chavez
Edward Schumacher-Matos
21 August 2009
The Washington Post
A25
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is a liar and a troublemaker. Congressmen and columnists can say this, but
President Obama is correct not to do so, even though his critics want a tougher U.S. policy against the Venezuelan.
A testament to the success of diplomatic finesse is that Chavez and his pan-regional socialist dreams have been losing
ground in Latin America since the inauguration of Obama and his appointment of Hillary Clinton as secretary of state.
In the past week alone, two Chavez allies have broken ranks. Ecuador and Venezuela were teamed against neighboring
Colombia over a guerrilla war there. But Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa has just accepted an olive branch offered by
Colombian President Alvaro Uribe.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Here is what we have come up with as agreed language from Bob, Eric, Mike, Melanne, Lissa and me. This can be used
for the letter and for press guidance. Melanne will send a letter to the GOSL and perhaps the UN Permrep. We will ask
the Post to release the letter to journalists in Colombo once it is received. I will schedule a press briefing at the Foreign
Press Center early this week, which will attract a good number of Asian journalists, and make sure the question is asked
so we can put it in proper context. We will have it for guidance in the Main State briefing if asked. PJ
BEGIN TEXT
Questions have been raised regarding remarks by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on September 30 before the United
Nations Security Council on the adoption of a resolution to combat sexual violence in armed conflict. In her statement,
she said that we have seen rape used as a tactic before in a number of countries, including Sri Lanka.
Regarding the Secretary's reference to Sri Lanka in her address, we want to be clear. Over the course of the difficult
conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), stretching into this
decade, the State Department as well as credible human rights organizations reported numerous cases of rape and
sexual violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government. This was
the basis for the Secretary's statement. At the same time, in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009,
though we remained deeply concerned about reports of extrajudicial killings, disappearances and mistreatment of
detainees, we have not received reports that rape and sexual abuse were usedas tools of war, as they clearly have in
other conflict areas around the world. We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context.I'm happy to have Melanne send it as letter to GOSL Ambassador and maybe UN Rep and only release to SL and related
outlets.pverveer <pvervee
We are waiting for DRL to clear the language. I will call Mike and/or Karen now. Everyone else is comfortable. Then we

2684,2009-08-21T04:00:00+00:00,"Message from scott grationHuma, Special Envoy Gration is asking that this message be passed to the Secretary.Secretary Clinton, greetings from Juba, Southern Sudan, where we've just held our latest round of trilateral
talks between the Southern People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) and National Congress Party (NCP),
facilitated by the United States. This update outlines the outcomes of our trilateral and bilateral discussions,
and highlights of the some important issues that will influence our planning in the months ahead. In addition,
I'll pass on some impressions from my visit to the Kenana Sugar Factory that illustrates why I believe we need
smarter sanctions for Sudan.
SPLM and NCP Agreement
Yesterday I witnessed the initialing of a bilateral agreement between the SPLM and NCP, in which the parties
laid out points of agreement on ten of the twelve major outstanding issues in the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement (CPA). Culminating three months of negotiations, this agreement documents a shared vision for
implementing the Abyei arbitration decision, for moving forward on border demarcation, for completing legal
reforms, and for resolving other key issues. If the parties match their words with actions, it will bring them
closer to full CPA implementation and to peaceful coexistence. To ensure implementation, we have backed up
the agreement with timelines and a stoplight chart that we will use to hold both parties accountable to their
words.
With this agreement, we can now turn our full attention to resolving the electoral census and the referenda
for self-determination. We will resume our trilateral talks in Juba in early September. These two issues are
the most controversial and potentially destabilizing challenges facing Sudan. It appears likely that we will
ultimately have to raise these politically sensitive issues to the level of the Presidency (President Bashir, Vice
President Kiir, and Vice President Taha) to reach final agreement. I will keep you posted on my discussions
and the potential for meetings at the Presidency-level in Khartoum or Juba.

directors later Friday that will discuss the sale of its German unit Adam Opel GmbH.
The government will then assess what it believes will be a fundamental signal on which of the two remaining bids for the
unit the company favors, economics ministry spokeswoman Beatrix Brodkorb said Friday.
The meeting is due to take place in the afternoon, central European time, according to the government.
Austrian-Canadian car parts maker Magna International Inc. (MGA), in a consortium with Russian savings banks OAO
Sberbank (SBER.RS), and Belgian private equity firm RHJ International SA (RHJI.BT) have recently presented revised
bids for Opel and its sister company, U.K.-based Vauxhall.
Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is keen to rescue jobs at Opel ahead of the Sept. 27 general election, has
lobbied hard for Magna to be win the bid, while GM in the past has preferred RHJ.
Government spokesman Klaus Vater said Friday that there is currently ""some movement,"" and Brodkorb said the
government has been in contact with the U.S. on Opel over the past 24 hours.
Brodkorb stressed that Germany's offer to provide the entire EUR4.5 billion in state aid for Opel came after GM asked
Germany to provide more details on aid for the Magna bid but made no request for more state aid details for RHJ.
The offer to pay state subsidies entirely and upfront without other European countries that have Opel and Vauxhall plants
""is an offer to other countries to help get a fast decision,"" Brodkorb said.
Other European countries with Opel plants include Spain, the U.K., Poland and Belgium.
The U.K. government is reportedly irritated by Germany's offer to entirely shoulder state guarantees of up to EUR4.5
billion in the deal because a decision on state aid wouldn't be up to Germany alone since the Opel bids also involve
Vauxhall and production sites in Spain and Poland.
Opel has around 50,000 staff in Europe, of which around half are based in Germany.

We've been in contact with Salam Alshehri, the project coordinator of the newly launched Entelak school program
Glamour helped create for young girls through Sana'a's Girls World Communication Center. She reports that they are in
contact with Nujood who is in fact in third grade at a private school. While Nujood isn't in the demographic for the
Entelak Project since she's still young enough for public (free) education, she is the role model for the targeted
girls. And since Nujood is the spirit of the Project, Salam and her colleagues are thinking of ways to include her in the
activities and trainings as much as possible.
We've also spoken to Delphine Minoui, the French reporter who first covered Nujood's case and has since co-written
Nujood's autobiography. Delphine has taken on the funding of Nujood's private schooling and confirms that Nujood is in
fact still attending school. CNN got it wrong apparently,"",

It's 3 a.m. Do You Know Where Hillary Clinton Is?
By David Rothkopf
Washington Post
Sunday, August 23, 2009
When it comes to Hillary Rodham Clinton, we're missing the forest for the pantsuits.
Clinton is not the first celebrity to become the nation's top diplomat -- that honor goes to her most distant predecessor,
Thomas Jefferson, who by the time he took office was one of the most famous and gossiped-about men in America --
but she may be the biggest. And during her first seven months in office, the former first lady, erstwhile presidential
candidate and eternal lightning rod has drawn more attention for her moods, looks, outtakes and (of course)
relationship with her husband than for, well, her work revamping the nation's foreign policy.
Even venerable publications -- such as one to which I regularly contribute, Foreign Policy -- have woven into their all-
Hillary-all-the-time coverage odd discussions of Clinton's handbag and scarf choices. Daily Beast editor Tina Brown, while
depicting herself as a Clinton supporter, has been scathing and small-minded in discussing such things as Clinton's
weight and hair, while her ""defense"" of Hillary in her essay ""Obama's Other Wife"" was as sexist as the title suggests.
Indeed, sexism has followed Clinton from the campaign trail to Foggy Bottom, as seen most recently in the posturing
outrage surrounding the exchange in Congo when Clinton reacted with understandable frustration to the now-infamous
question regarding her husband's views. Major media outlets have joined the gossipfest, whether the New York Times,
which covered Clinton's first big policy speech by discussing whether she was in or out with the White House, or The
Washington Post, where a couple of reporters mused about whether a brew called Mad Bitch would be the beer of
choice for the secretary of state.
Amid all the distractions, what is Clinton actually doing? Only overseeing what may be the most profound changes in
U.S. foreign policy in two decades -- a transformation that may render the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W.
Bush mere side notes in a long transition to a meaningful post-Cold War worldview.
The secretary has quietly begun rethinking the very nature of diplomacy and translating that vision into a revitalized
State Department, one that approaches U.S. allies and rivals in ways that challenge long-held traditions. And despite the
pessimists who invoked the ""team of rivals"" cliche to predict that President Obama and Clinton would not get along,",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

We have just learned that Tim Rieser may call you soon to request that the Secretary call Senator Reid to urge

the negative impact of a continuing resolution on State operations and programs.
As you know, if Senator Reid was able/willing to schedule time on the Senate floor there still remains a
significant obstacle. While the FY10 Bill had broad bipartisan support prior to markup, it now includes a
controversial Lautenberg amendment that would reverse the Mexico City policy statutorily. With
Lautenberg's amendment in the Bill, procedural hurdles are almost certain to lengthen and slow down floor
action.
It is possible that an agreement could be reached to bring up the Bill and structure votes so that the
Republicans could offer amendments including one to strike Lautenberg's language.
Should you agree to ask the Secretary to make such a call I would imagine she would want to get views from
Jack Lew, Pat Kennedy, Rich Greene, and Rich Verma, first.Cheryl:

what we are doing rather than the other way around. The Embassy statement does include removal of supervisors. I
wonder from a contracting and legal standpoint how to react if asked to POGO's suggestion that supervisors are not
allowed to work for another contractor. While people have a right to work, I believe we get to review a contractor's
management team and instruct them on who is acceptable or not, right? I don't necessarily buy into POGO's Nuremberg
defense, that people are exonerated because they were forced to debase themselves. But I see the release below as

Thank you for the call on Thursday and for your understanding about my need to take care of certain
responsibilities before I depart as SCSL Prosecutor.
The Taylor testimony is going well from our point of view. He is opening himself to a devastating CX by
telling unexpected and unnecessary lies about his activities in Liberia and the region. I have been using my
access to senior Liberian, Sierra Leone, and UN officials to obtain new evidence with which to confront
him. This is well in hand and I dont see a problem in leaving even if Taylor is still on the stand on September
7. The major reason to stay as Prosecutor until that date (aside from the requirement of a 30-day notice to the
UNSG) is the oral argument on the appeal of our last case in Freetown (involving historic gender violence
convictions) on September 2, 3, and 4.
However, from my conversations with Clint, I am concerned that there are several issues that are coming to
head at this time, and know that I will have to hit the ground very fast on September 8. Because my schedule is
light in the coming week and because I have some leave days to use, I have therefore planned a quick trip to DC
to be there from Wednesday noon through Saturday noon, August 26-29. I wont yet move into the office, but
the staff will help me schedule some informal meetings on several issues. Additionally, this will give me a
chance to look for a place to live.

NOT appear on the September 1 revolution day festivities (40th anniversary of the ""green revolution""). And
he said that he totally understood that Qadhafi should stay in New York and not set up a tent in New
Jersey. At the same time, others from the MFA called in our Embassy in Tripoli and called in the UK
ambassador. The Libyans are clearly looking for a way out of the self-inflicted mess. Let's hope that these
wiser heads can prevail on Qadhafi.

STATEMENT BY IAN KELLY, SPOKESMAN
Temporary Suspension of Non-Immigrant Visa Services in Honduras
The OAS Foreign Ministers mission is in Honduras seeking support for the San Jose Accord, which would restore the
democratic and constitutional order and resolve the political crisis in Honduras. In support of this mission and as a
consequence of the de facto regime's reluctance to sign the San Jose Accord, the U.S. Department of State is conducting a
full review of our visa policy in Honduras. As part of that review, we are suspending non-emergency, non-immigrant visa
services in the consular section of our embassy in Honduras, effective August 26. We firmly believe a negotiated solution
is the appropriate way forward and the San Jose Accord is the best solution.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Beihl called me from the plane just before departure. De facto negotiating team will return to DC Wednesday for
several days talks. While ministers were discouraged by de factor regime intransigence, Beihl said that Zelaya had also
lost some support. He said that all the ministers were shocked by Zelaya's behavior in a telephone conference call just
before their press conference this afternoon. Zelaya spoke of people dying by hundreds, being thrown in jail and
tortured. Zelaya appeared to be very out-of-touch, Beihl said. He added that ""even"" the Argentine FM was questioning
whether Z's return was the correct course. Beihl said that while a democratic solution was needed, perhaps Zelaya was
not the right option. I again expressed our position that the problem was not who replaced Zelaya, but that he was
removed unconstitutionally.
News conference was straightforward. Only one minister spoke (I don't know them by face), said that the solution was
return to democratic order and the regime not prepared to accept Si. I haven't got hold of transcript yet, will do so
asap.
Beihl again expressed thanks for our move on visas (as well as our logistical support), saying that all the ministers
thought it a good move.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

settlements, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said as he met a top American envoy in London on
Wednesday. Netanyahu has said ahead of his meeting with U.S. Mideast envoy George Mitchell that he wants an
agreement that allows Israel to proceed with some settlement construction while at the same time restarting peace
talks with the Palestinians. In the past week, both Israel and the U.S. have been signaling that an agreement could be
within reach. Speaking alongside Mitchell before the meeting, Netanyahu said he hoped peace negotiations would
resume ""shortly."" ""We are making headway. My government has taken steps in both words and deeds to move
forward,"" he said. But in the days preceding Wednesday's meeting, the key encounter of the Israeli leader's four-day
London trip, he also made clear he sees the spotlight on settlements as unfair and insisted the Mideast conflict is rooted
in a deep Arab enmity toward Israel that predates them.

near Poland. Vladimir Popovkin says that U.S. President Barack Obama's decision to dump the Bush-era plan to deploy

my piece....
Thanks again for Friday. Much favorable comment. Good luck at the UNGA.
President Barack Obama's announcement of a new system.for protecting America's
allies against Iranian missiles has ignited charges that he is scaling back the one he
inherited from George W. Bush as a concession to the Russians.
In fact, the Obama plan is a big improvement on the Bush one, and it is designed to
counter an evolving Iranian threat, not to mollify Russian anxieties.
Mr Bush's decision to put 10 missile interceptors in Poland and an associated radar in
the Czech Republic was based on a concern that Iran was developing long-range rockets
that could hit the US. The Bush system would have been less effective against shorter-
range Iranian missiles, and it would have left much of Europe, notably including America's
ally Turkey, unprotected.
Over the last several years, the Iranians have shifted their efforts from developing a few
long-range rockets to deploying large numbers of shorter-range ones that pose an
immediate danger to southeastern Europe and the Middle East, as well as to US forces
stationed there. Unlike Mr Bush's, Mr Obama's plan will quickly field a missile-defence
capability to address an existing threat. It can be upgraded to deal with longer-range
Iranian missiles in the future.
The Central Europeans who have reacted to the decision with apprehension or alarm
should recognize that the replacement of a conceptually flawed plan with a more credible
one strengthens the bonds of transatlantic defence.
The view from Moscow has been clouded by outright paranoia. Military experts there
suspected that the US rockets in Poland, while advertised as defensive, could be used
offensively, even pre-emptively, against Russia. Laying to rest that far-fetched scenario
was not the prime motivation for Mr Obama's decision, nor should it have been. However,
by removing what has been a gratuitous irritant in bilateral relations, the president has
improved the prospects for US-Russian arms control negotiations now underway in
Geneva.
Those talks could produce by December a new treaty reducing numbers of strategic -
that is, intercontinental — weapons. If ratified by the US Senate (which will not be easy,
given the ferocity of the partisan wars in Washington), the US and Russia will be on track
for further reductions in the future. Mr Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev,
who are due to meet in New York this week, have jointly called for the eventual goal of
eliminating nuclear weapons.
As they and their successors take steps in that direction, they will have to grapple with a",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

We are likely to have one candidate against Hosni in round 4 of the UNESCO director general race on Monday.
EU Commissioner Ferraro-Waldner has pulled out formally.
Our UNESCO Amb. Killion reports that candidates Baki (Ecuador) and Bukova (Bulgaria) met Sunday night Paris time.
Baki has given Bukova an ultimatum. Either they form a unity ticket with Ivonne Baki on top or Baki leaves the race.
Tonight former Ferrero-Waldner supporters are considering how to vote. Mexican Dep Secretary for 10 issues called
me. They are wondering whether to support Baki in round 4 now that F-W is out.
I noted that we wanted the strongest of the ladies to stay in (Fyi, they both were on our list of the most qualified
candidates.) Too early a pull out could also affect the race.
The Egyptian candidate could lose because of a consolidation of alternative candidates.
I am sorry to report that the Egyptians have used harsh tactics in the halls of UNESCO. A member of the U.S. delegation
has seen a member of the Egyptian-hired ""public relations"" group walking around with an envelope of cash. They
pushed to have two Amb recalled. Disgust and resentment is running high.
The Egyptians are pushing delegations very hard. FM Aboul-Gheit has stopped in Paris to deal with the UNESCO race
while en route to NY for UNGA.
A/S Feltman writes that Egyptian Ambassador Shoukry has called him twice today with a ""message from the Foreign
Minister."" FM Aboul Gheit is angry and reports President Mubarak is angry.
A/S Feltman notes "" maybe we've become a convenient excuse."" A/S Feltman very helpfully pushed back and helped
defend our ambassador who had been criticized.
Our strategy relies on our Amb being low-key. He is following his instructions. We should be unhappy with the way he is
being attacked personally. Candidates Bukova and Baki are moving ahead on their own lobbying. FYI, Hosni even said
on French TV that the U.S. is neutral reflecting our especially low key approach this past week. Now that Hosni may
lose, the U.S. looks like a convenient one to blame.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Cairo had slated a signing ceremony for October 25. The agreement would resolve nothing immediately but
would outline steps to restore Palestinian unity. Hamas runs the Gaza Strip and Fatah dominates in the Israeli-
occupied West Bank.
The official told Reuters no new date was set for signing.
""Egypt saw it was better to delay until there is a suitable atmosphere,"" he said.
Abbas admits his government erred in approving a U.N. decision in Geneva two weeks ago to delay action on
the so-called Goldstone report, which is particularly critical of Israel for alleged war crimes during the Gaza
offensive.
He has reversed course and the issue was being reconsidered on Friday at a special session of the U.N. Human
Rights Council in Geneva, which Abbas requested.
""We are not going to let things collapse,"" said another Egyptian official of his country's lengthy mediation
between the Palestinian factions which began over a year ago.
""We will wait until the dust settles and activate efforts again and I hope that will be very soon.""
The deal would postpone Palestinian presidential and parliamentarian elections until June 28, 2010.
Fatah has signed it and this week Abbas announced that if Hamas did not sign he would go ahead with elections
in January as called for by the constitution.
It is unclear how Fatah would be able to hold a full election since Hamas has vowed to block voting in Gaza if
the ballot was scheduled without its agreement.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my longstanding commitment to assist the Haitian people in
their pursuit of a stable, prosperous and democratic future.
During my trip to Haiti, I was reminded of the tremendous challenges facing this island nation. The U.N.'s appointment
of President Clinton as special envoy to Haiti has helped to keep a much-needed spotlight on Haiti. President Clinton's
appointment of Dr. Paul Farmer as the Deputy U.N. Special Envoy for Haiti, adds an invaluable wealth of experience and
knowledge to the U.N.'s work in Haiti.
As a founder of Partners in Health and the Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti, Dr. Farmer has demonstrated a
selfless commitment to the advancement of health and democracy in Haiti for the past 20 years. I have witnessed
firsthand Dr. Farmer's dedication to helping improve the lives of those in need.
He has strong south Florida ties. I am proud to call him a friend, along with our mutual friend, Jennie Block, who has also
worked so hard on issues of concern to the Haitian community.
I understand that the conference on the Inter-American Development Bank in Haiti went quite well. I was pleased to see
that the United Nations voted unanimously this week to extend the authorization for the U.N. Mission in Haiti for
another year.
I would also like to take a moment to express my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in last
weekend's plane crash during a U.N. mission. The U.N. mission in Haiti has helped to play an important role in bringing
security and stability to some of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Haiti. I continue to support its mission and the

American-made missiles to expand its capability to strike land targets, a potential

The charge, which set off a new outbreak of tensions between the United States and

Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani and other top Pakistani officials.
The accusation comes at a particularly delicate time, when the administration is asking
Congress to approve $7.5 billion in aid to Pakistan over the next five years, and when
Washington is pressing a reluctant Pakistani military to focus its attentions on fighting
the Taliban, rather than expanding its nuclear and conventional forces aimed at India.

Kelly, Craig A; Webster, Christopher W;
I just received a call from Arias. He expressed his appreciation for everything the US had done in support of democracy
in Honduras. He said the recent tough messages by Insulza, OAS Ambassadors and USG officials. strengthened by US
sanctions, was having an impact on the M regime. He praised our decision to close the consulate and urged that we also
move to take away tourist and business visas from key regime members and supporters. I told him we were working on
implementing the visa and other measures which I expected could be announced soon.
Arias was critical of Z saying his recent public statements continued to be unhelpful. He described Z's statement
advocating the death penalty (presumably to apply to his political enemies) and asking for the extension of his term in
office as ""disastrous"". He said that Insulza had made the right call by not allowing Z to address the OASGA. We agreed
the influence of FM Rodas over Z was highly negative,
I told Arias I would be back in Honduras tomorrow and planned in the coming days to press influential political, business
and civil society and urge support for the immediate signing of the Si Accord. Arias and I agreed to stay in close touch in

You may recall that Melanne and I were developing ideas for holding events to connect people working on women's
issues around the world, and to raise the visibility of the issues in the US.
Whitney Williams has joined us to flesh out a vision for a series of conferences that would bring together policymakers
and experts from the field with women you have met around the world - and people at the grassroots level in this
country.
Each conference would be followed by a special event featuring musical, cultural and culinary celebrities (yep, celebrity
chefs) from the U.S. and other countries to generate visibility online and in the entertainment media, which would reach
a lot more people than the policy conference alone.
These events would create connections among people who often work in isolation, and generate ideas for improving
policies and practices. They'd also inspire and engage a whole new generation to get involved in global women's issues.
This approach — bringing together policy, grassroots and entertainment aspects — isn't being done by anyone else in the
development space. It would be a great way to raise the visibility of the issues, and your work on them, here at home.
We could put on several over the next year, with one on the 15th Anniversary of your UN speech in Beijing.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

CdmErica, we are of course always ready to help. But I have to say the way in which these papers have been tasked has
been, frankly, chaotic. For two Fridays in a row we were sent taskers after 9 or 10 pm with short deadlines, and fulfillment
of one set of requirements has only led to another. We also note that there has not generally been an effort to distinguish
among bureaus in terms of substantive responsibilities and NEA has repeatedly had to refer USUN-W to other bureaus,
especially PRM and somewhat mystifyingly, 10.
I am honestly not quite sure what is needed now. There is already an 10-drafted paper on Israel in the UN that I cleared
Friday evening. Are you asking us to script her on that topic for her meetings? I doubt very much that Ambassador Rice's
interlocutors will seek to draw her into a discussion of the Israeli or Palestinian economies and I can't think why she would
raise that topic with them and what policy points we would expect her to make in the context of her visit. If you really need
background papers on the two economies, we can give you them.

Ideologues hijack a compromise
By Edward Schumacher-Matos
Friday, November 6, 2009
Adults learn that human conflicts are seldom black and white. So the way the international community jumped
to punish tiny Honduras for the ouster of its president, without knowing the facts, was foolish.
That some Senate Republicans have been extremist in the other direction borders on galling. Opposing a U.S.-
brokered agreement reached a week ago by Hondurans to defuse the crisis, the senators, led by South Carolina's
Jim DeMint, have been grandstanding on principles that have little to do with reality, contributing to looming
chaos in that Central American country and undermining U.S. policy in the region.
In this, the age of fundamentalist ayatollahs, the knee-jerk cold warriors among the Senate Republicans are no
better than the knee-jerk anti-military officials in the Organization of American States.
The compromise leaves egg on the face of the OAS and an intelligentsia that refused to see Honduras as more
than a banana republic that somehow could infect the region, only to be confronted by a Senate cabal that treats
Honduras as . . . a banana republic that somehow could infect the rest of the region.
The former see this impoverished backwater of 8 million people setting off a chain of military coups, while the
latter see it setting off a chain of leftist dictatorships. The two share an equally misguided domino theory.
Poor Honduras, in the meantime.
The compromise, put together by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and -- yes -- sensible State Department
diplomats, creatively settled on a process instead of an end. Ousted President Manuel Zelaya and de facto
President Roberto Micheletti agreed to allow the Honduran Congress, with the advice of that country's Supreme
Court, to resolve the question of whether Zelaya should return to office for the last 2 1/2 months of his term.I assume you saw this, but just in case:

Afghanistan and wants to discuss our commitment.
Lastly, as Pres, Karzai is beginning to plan his cabinet, perhaps you could mention to him the need to bring in some of the
talented and experienced women into his government. At our Shura meeting yesterday, we discussed upcoming

Yesterday, when I left Tegucigalpa, we used the departure to put more pressure on M. I called a top M aide and said I
was leaving, and that if my message in Washington was that M refused to help us help him, we would have to take our
own steps to make clear our position on Honduras. (They assume that means visas stay revoked and more could be
pulled.) We preferred to achieve our objectives through a patriotic gesture on M's part (a step-aside) but we have to
protect our principles and our interests in the region. Washington would be very disappointed that M refused to
cooperate with the country that has done the most to promote support for the October 30 Accord and promote support
for elections in his country. Moreover, M would be passing up a chance to go down in history as a statesman as
opposed the man who launched a coup.
Last night the aide called Hugo to say that M had considered this again and was sensitive to our arguments. He had
decided to make a speech today (November 19) to announce that he as ""absenting himself"" for the days preceding the
election through December 2 —the date of the vote on Z's restitution in the Congress. The latter is a significant date,
because if Z wins the vote, M is gone, and if Z loses the vote, M has no reason to stay to keep Z out. M will leave the
country in the control of a sort of executive council.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

It's been 89 days since Manuel Zelaya was booted from power. He's sleeping on chairs, and he claims his
throat is sore from toxic gases and ""Israeli mercenaries"" are torturing him with high-frequency radiation.
""We are being threatened with death,"" he said in an interview with The Miami Herald, adding that
mercenaries were likely to storm the embassy where he has been holed up since Monday and
assassinate him.
""I prefer to march on my feet than to live on my knees before a military dictatorship,"" Zelaya said in a
series of back-to-back interviews.
Zelaya was deposed at gunpoint on June 28 and slipped back into his country on Monday, just two
days before he was scheduled to speak before the United Nations. He sought refuge at the Brazilian
Embassy, where Zelaya said he is being subjected to toxic gases and radiation that alter his physical
and mental state.
Witnesses said that for a short time Tuesday morning, soldiers used a device that looked like a large
satellite dish to emit a loud shrill noise.
Honduran police spokesman Orlin Cerrato said he knew nothing of any radiation devices being used
against the former president.
""He says there are mercenaries against him? Using some kind of apparatus?"" Cerrato said. ""No, no,",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Dear Madame Secretary,
When we last spoke at the Corporate Council on Africa you were kind enough to invite me to pay a call on you when in
DC. As it turns out, I will be in Washington for most of next week, arriving the afternoon of the 16th and returning to Santa
Fe the evening of the 201h ( the return is flexible if you were available to see me over the weekend.) I realize that you are
traveling this week and possibly into next, but I wanted to reach out to you. As I wrote to you earlier, I am a director for
Symbion Power and may soon assume more direct responsibility for all of Africa as Symbion expands there from its
current operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Symbion's competitive advantage is its reliance on local partnering and
human capacity development in the execution of its projects. Its success in the most difficult and dangerous
environments has been very impressive, as the four minute video that Sid gave to you on my behalf demonstrates. We
now want to bring that business model and philosophy to Africa where the social entrepreneurship and the development
of skilled labor is imperative for Africa's long term economic prospects, as you have so forcefully articulated in past
comments.
am very enthusiastic about Symbion. It is one or
the very few American companies outside the petroleum sector willing to establish itself and to undertake projects in
Africa. With our record of success elsewhere, we are certain that our approach to project development and execution will
mesh nicely with African needs and U.S. policy priorities.
Valerie, Trevor and Samantha join me in extending our best wishes to you, Bill, and Chelsea as we enter the holiday
season.

We've had a near-constant dialogue with Baucus' office on this, and I'm afraid we haven't been able to, and aren't likely in
the near future, to satisfy them.
1) Development and environmental protection on the Flathead River is a long-running source of tension between Montana
and British Columbia. To protect the Flathead Basin, Sen. Baucus has long championed restrictions against development
on both sides of the border.
2) Over the years, the USG has worked closely with the Canadian federal government to ensure several Canadian
mining proposals were fully assessed for environmental impact. To date, the British Columbia provincial government has
not approved any mining proposals in the Flathead Basin—and there are no additional proposals on the horizon.
3) The Senator would like to see B.C. and Canada move toward a more permanent way to protect the region, rather than
having to battle each new mining proposal. For example, environmental NGOs advocate the Canadians establishing a
national park or other development moratorium.
4) While we certainly agree with that approach in principal, the problem is that under Canada's system, provincial
governments hold the authority over natural resource management. Therefore, even though the Canadian park
service likewise would favor a national park in the northern Flathead Basin, nothing can happen without the agreement of
the Province of British Columbia.
5) British Columbia has informed us that they see no need for broader, more permanent protections in the Flathead Basin,
and believe their environmental assessment process gives adequate protection against development-related threats.
6) Because of the federal-provincial dynamic in Canada, the Canadian federal government can't really compel British
Columbia to establish permanent protections in the Flathead Basin.
7) Glacier National Park and the Canadian Waterton Lakes National Park are U.N. World Heritage Sites. The U.N. World
Heritage committee recently sent a mission to the Flathead basin, to assess potential threats to the two national
parks. Their report is expected this month or next. The release of the report will provide us an opportunity to engage B.C.
and Canada again on the future of the Flathead region.Hi Tom. I don't think you ever followed back up on this. Can you let me know how we can address his concerns? Thanks.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

3255,2009-11-12T05:00:00+00:00,"November 12, 2009 - Dems Fade In Ohio Senate Race, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Obama Gets
Negative Score In Key Swing State
Word format
For the first time, Republican Rob Portman is inching ahead of the two Democrats in the 2010 race for Ohio's
U.S. Senate seat, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today. Also for the first time, Ohio voters
disapprove 50 - 45 percent of the job President Barack Obama is doing, down from his 53 - 42 percent approval
September 16 and 49 - 44 percent approval July 7.
In still another first, voters are split 40 - 40 percent on who is doing a better job handling health care, the
President or Congressional Republicans, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh- pe-ack) University survey
finds. In a September 16 survey on the same question, Obama was on top 49 - 28 percent.
Ohio voters disapprove 53 - 42 percent of the way the President is handling the economy and disapprove 57 -
36 percent of the way he is handling health care. In September, they approved of his handling of the economy
48 - 46 percent and split on his handling of health care 44 - 45 percent.
""The Democratic wave that swept through Ohio in 2006 and 2008 may be cresting. The Democratic lead in the
Governor's and Senate races has evaporated and for the first time President Barack Obama is under water in the
most important swing state in the country,"" said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University
Polling Institute.
""Ohio voters are not happy with the President's handling of health care and the economy. The fact that they now
are split whether he or the Republicans in Congress are better able to handle health care should be a very
worrisome number at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. since the GOP is still pretty much a four-letter word in most of
America.""
Independent voters, often the group that decides Ohio elections, disapprove 49 - 45 percent of the overall job
Obama is doing and disapprove 54 - 39 percent of his handling of the economy. They disapprove 62 - 34
percent, almost 2-1, of his handling of health care.
""In July, when the President's job approval began falling nationally from the high 50s and low 60s into the low
50s, Ohio was the first place it showed up in the polls,"" said Brown.
Portman, a former Congressman running for the U.S. Senate in 2010, has small leads over two Democrats,
topping Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner 38 - 34 percent and Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher 39 - 36 percent. In the
battle for the Democratic Senate nomination, Fisher gets 24 percent to Brunner's 22 percent, with 51 percent
undecided. Portman leads car dealer Tom Ganley 26 - 7 percent in a GOP primary with 64 percent undecided.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Republican lawyer based in Richmond who also writes a column for Human Events. I disagree with the ideological and
partisan undercurrent of the piece, especially his overemphasis of the deficit as an overriding political factor rather than
the administration's lack of achievable results so far in improving the living standards of ordinary people. There is no
reason why the deficit shouldn't become a merely abstract factor once there are actual benefits delivered. The pattern of
the past is that the deficit, the talisman of Hoover Republicans, moves only partisan Republicans and that Democrats
ascend if the economy is progressing, its gains are widely spread and new social programs have favorable universal
impact. That is not happening now. This analysis, therefore, may be portentous. Worth reading. The electoral maps of VA

Can the Clinton Coalition Survive Obama?
By Sean Trende
John Judis and Ruy Teixeira's well-regarded 2002 work The Emerging Democratic Majority begins with a vignette set in
Virginia. They tell the story of a telecom executive named Mark Warner, who runs a moderate campaign that appeals to
upper-middle class suburbanites and working class rural voters, and manages to put together a winning coalition that, if
imitated in other states, might put the Democrats in power for decades to come.
Democrats did build coalitions similar to Warner's, and in fact had been doing so for the better part of a decade. Warner's
coalition was essentially Bill Clinton's 1996 coalition. The coalition and brand that Clinton built was an extraordinarily
successful one for Democrats, breaking the momentum of a resurgent GOP in 1996, and ultimately enabling the election
of the most liberal President in American History last year.
Given this background, it's only appropriate that the first tangible sign that this coalition is coming unglued has come in
Virginia. Republican Bob McDonnell won the governorship with almost 59% of the vote — the highest percentage (though
not the highest victory margin) for any governor since 1961. The entire Republican ticket won by similar margins, and the
GOP picked up six seats in the General Assembly. It could have been even worse — five Democrats won their Assembly
races by fewer than 1,000 votes.
There are some superficial lessons to be drawn here. After last week's election, it's silly to argue that the GOP brand is
too damaged for them to take advantage of Democratic weakness. And the Democrats' latest spin — that their weakness
among Independents was simply a function of more Republicans calling themselves independents but retaining their
Republican voting habits — puts the lie to the argument that Republicans' low self-identification is a salient factor in
elections.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

U.S. offers new role for Pakistan
A BROADER PARTNERSHIP
Importance of country to Afghan effort recognized
By Karen DeYoung
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, November 30, 2009
President Obama has offered Pakistan an expanded strategic partnership, including additional military and
economic cooperation, while warning with unusual bluntness that its use of insurgent groups to pursue policy
goals ""cannot continue.""
The offer, including an effort to help reduce tensions between Pakistan and India, was contained in a two-page
letter delivered to President Asif Ali Zardari this month by Obama national security adviser James L. Jones. It
was accompanied by assurances from Jones that the United States will increase its military and civilian efforts
in Afghanistan and that it plans no early withdrawal.
Obama's speech Tuesday night at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., will address primarily the
Afghanistan aspects of the strategy. But despite the public and political attention focused on the number of new
troops, Pakistan has been the hot core of the months-long strategy review. The long-term consequences of
failure there, the review concluded, far outweigh those in Afghanistan.
""We can't succeed without Pakistan,"" a senior administration official involved in the White House review said.
""You have to differentiate between public statements and reality. There is nobody who is under any illusions
about this.""
This official and others, all of whom spoke about the closely held details of the new strategy on the condition of
anonymity, emphasized that without ""changing the nature of U.S.-Pakistan relations in a new direction, you're
not going to win in Afghanistan,"" as one put it. ""And if you don't win in Afghanistan, then Pakistan will
automatically be imperiled, and that will make Afghanistan look like child's play.""Huma — The Secretary asked to see a copy of this article from yesterday's Washington Post. Would you pass it

unconfirmed. The potential implications on the peace process are not yet clear. At the moment, regional
leaders are responding cautiously and the impact on other regional processes does not appear
significant. The Armenian Ministry of Defense denied any unusual activity along the line of contact; the
Azerbaijan Ministry of Defense told media that incidents are frequent along the line of contact. Embassy
Yerevan reports that it is customary to deny reports of sniper incidents along the line of contact, but that an
incident of this magnitude would be difficult to cover up. Embassy Baku notes that President Aliyev is in
Kazakhstan and local authorities could be waiting for his return before deciding on how to proceed. Neither of

It'f,1the Coratztion, Stupid
Rep. Jane Harman
In rnr..
.ent weeks, prominent American politicians and columnists have begun debating troop levels in
Afghanistan. Some call for a complete withdrawal, while others favor increasing the number of U.S. troops.
The size of U.S. forces in Afghanistan is a critical issue, but a debate about troop strength misses the point.
Unless and until one other problem is addressed, neither more troops nor fewer troops will reverse the tide of
terrorism being fomented in Afghanistan or improve our national security.
It I he corruption, sturici.
Eliminating corruption in Afghanistan is in both that nation's interest and ours. From the Afghan perspective, an
honest government would give the people a genuine say in the direction of their country. For us, it would
dramatically increase our national security, both because it would increase the effectiveness of our efforts to
fight the Taiiban and because the end result would be an Afghan population more invested in taking on the fight
themselves. That is our real objective.
Wrion I traveled tc P..tgrianistan in April with Sen. Jon Kyl, Arizona Republican, we were warned by opposition
candidates that the country's presidential election would be marred by widespread fraud. They were right. On
top of everything else that we have learned about the Afghan government, the vote that took place on Aug. 20
was a sham. Every indication. is that the election results have been completely skewed by widespread,
sys..fematic
Afghan politics have never been particularly clean -- money, power and position traditionally have been traded",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

as possible to determine how we might be of assistance to her and her family. (Michael knows Asha and believes she
may be in Nairobi, but will find out asap where she is. Asha's family, husband and children, are generally resident in
Nairobi.) I've asked Michael to secure Kenyan police protection for the family while they are in Kenya and to explore
with Asha whether she is interested in looking for a way to come to the U.S. via some type of application for refugee
status. Michael will ask our consular officers to explore the options available if Asha wants to consider them.
I also alerted Michael to the fact that Asha's brother was seriously wounded in the bombing. I have asked that they get
a full name as soon as possible and to see what we can do through the TFG, the UN and AMISOM to have him flown to
Nairobi. Michael said that he and the embassy have already arranged for a private hospital in to treat the seriously
injured who are being arriving by special flights in Nairobi. If we can identify Asha's brother, we will give him priority.

Brazil signals recognition of Honduran election
(AP) –40 minutes ago
RIO DE JANEIRO —A top Brazilian official has signaled that Latin America's largest nation may recognize the Honduran candidate who won
last weekend's post-coup presidential election.
Dilma Rousseff is chief of staff for Brazilian President Luiz !neck) Lula da Silva. Rousseff says the Central American country's Nov. 29 election
should be considered separately from the June 28 coup that ousted ex-President Manuel Zelaya.
Previously, the government had said it would not recognize the election unless Zelaya was returned to office and allowed to serve out his term,
which ends Jan. 27.
Rousseff told Brazilian television late Friday from Germany that the coup ""is one thing"" and ""discussing the election"" another.
She says ""this new process"" — the election — ""has to be considered.""",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

CONFIDENTIAL
December 15, 2009Re: The Berlusconi assault
The physical attack on Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is a major political event in Italy and
Europe. His assailant is a mentally disturbed man without a political agenda who has been in and out of
psychiatric care since he was 18 years old. Nonetheless, the assault has significant repercussions. It has
generated sympathy for Berlusconi as a victim—he has been obviously injured, lost two teeth and a pint
of blood, and doctors will keep him in the hospital for perhaps a week for observation. The attack comes
as Berlusconi was beginning to lose political footing, having lost his legal immunity. One court inquiry
is turning up evidence of his links to the Mafia while another is examining his role in the bribery case of
British lawyer David Mills. Berlusconi's government and party have used the attack as a way to turn the
sudden sympathy for him to his advantage, claiming that his opponents have sown a climate of ""hate.""
Through demogogic appeals they are attempting to discredit and rebuff the legal proceedings against
him and undermine the investigative press. (Berlusconi is suing La Repu.bblica, the large independent
newspaper in Rome that has been most aggressive in digging into his affairs of all kind.)
It would seem proper and decent for the President to call Berlusconi to express his concern about his health
and wish him a speedy recovery, if he hasn't done so already. There are many reasons for Oba.ma to do
this, not least to condemn violence against a democratically elected head of state. It would be awkward
for the U.S. President not to call a Western head of state of a NATO country who has been physically
harmed. Berlusconi, for his part, would certainly make such a call public. It would therefore also be
awkward if a call were used only as an element in his sympathy campaign against the court proceedings.
If so, there is a larger message that should be communicated, perhaps by the President in his conversation,
but most importantly through a statement from the State Department, also conveyed by the U.S.
ambassador in Italy. The USG condemns any and all violence as an assault on democracy. By the same
measure, this incident involving an apparently deranged individual should not be exploited to raise",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

we should do some sort of meeting now with international gay groups to lay out what we have done.

This Week in Copenhagen
December 12, 2009
Editorial
We didn't expect much from the first week of the global warming conference in Copenhagen. Countries need to
do a little posturing before getting down to the hard work, which is supposed to start on Monday. But the
belligerent talk from China seemed to go well beyond the usual positioning.
The best hope is that the talks will produce an interim understanding under which industrialized countries would
commit to fairly precise targets for reduced emissions, and others, like China, to broader but measurable goals.
The industrial countries would be expected to help poorer countries shift to less-polluting forms of energy.
That would set the stage for a legally binding deal in 2010. But there is no chance of even an interim agreement
without the enthusiastic participation of China, the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. China's absence would
give other developing countries — and the United States Senate — an excuse to do less than needed.
Beijing's recent pledge to slow the growth in emissions seemed like a positive shift in attitude. Then on
Tuesday, in a surprising show of defensiveness, China's top negotiator, Su Wei, said the greatest burden rested
with the industrialized countries and jumped on the United States, Japan and the European Union for not being
aggressive enough. Another Chinese official urged Washington to do ""some deep soul-searching"" and improve
its proposal.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

3482,2009-11-25T05:00:00+00:00,"Will do. Below is the formal statement that was released in the PM's name:
Today, my cabinet authorized a policy of restraint regarding settlements which will include a suspension of new permits
and new construction in Judea and Samaria for a period of ten months.
My cabinet authorized this far reaching step because of our deep desire for peace.
We hope that this decision will help launch meaningful peace negotiations to reach a historic peace agreement that will
finally end the conflict between the Palestinians and Israel.
We are committed to working closely with the United States to advance peace and security in the region.
We have been told by many friends that once Israel takes the first step towards peace, the Palestinians and the Arab
world would respond positively with steps of their own to create a virtuous cycle of goodwill.
Well, the government of Israel is taking a very big and difficult step toward peace today.
I hope that the Palestinians and the Arab world will seize this opportunity to work with us to forge a new beginning and
a new future for our children and for their children.
Since the day our government was sworn in eight months ago, we have been calling for direct negotiations with the
Palestinians.
During that time, we have taken many concrete actions to improve daily life for the Palestinians and to create a climate
in which political negotiations would have the best chance to succeed.
We have dismantled hundreds of roadblocks and checkpoints, extended the hours of operation on the Allenby Bridge
and removed bureaucratic obstacles to Palestinian economic development.
These actions have helped spur a surge, a boom, in the Palestinian economy. At the same time, the security
environment has improved thanks both to the efforts of the IDF and to the efforts of better trained PA security forces.
Now we wish to add to this improved economic and security climate meaningful political negotiations.
I have already said that we will not build new settlements and that we would not expropriate additional land for existing
settlements.
I said we would also restrain settlement activity, and that's exactly what we decided to do today.
I promised to enable normal life to continue for the three hundred thousand Israeli citizens, our brothers and sisters,
who live in Judea and Samaria.
That is why this suspension will not affect construction currently underway.Make sure Daniel R gets transcripts of what Mitchell and I said to the PA so Abbas can see it and if there is a transcript of
Bibi too.Netanyahu gave a press conference a few hours ago. I've seen plenty of his quotes in stories. Let me see if I can find

China sees no chance of climate deal - source
Thu Dec 17, 2009
Print I Single Page
By Krittivas Mukherjee and Pete Harrison
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - China has told participants in the U.N. climate change talks that it sees no possibility of
achieving an operational accord this week, an official involved in the Copenhagen talks said on Thursday.
Dozens of heads of state are descending on the Danish capital to address the December 7-18 conference, and had hoped
to sign on Friday a new pact to tackle global warming.
The official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters the Chinese had instead suggested issuing ""a short political
declaration of some sort,"" but it was not clear what that would say.
The official said negotiations were continuing to try to reach a breakthrough that would still allow an operational
agreement to be signed. The official said the sticking point for China appeared to be a process issue.
U.S. President Barack Obama has called for an ""operational accord"" -- essentially a political agreement with teeth that
can get countries working to cut or curb their greenhouse gas emissions while a more formal and binding treaty is
hammered out in 2010.
Some ministers warned that slow, often stalled talks during the summit meant it was staring at failure.
""We may not get there on the substance, it is quite possible we'll fail on the substance, but at least let's give it a try,""
said Britain's energy and climate minister Ed Miliband.
""At the moment the problem is we're not giving it a try.""
Developed and developing nations are at odds over who should cut emissions, how deep the cuts should be, and how
much funding should be provided to poor countries to help them shift to greener growth and adapt to a warmer world.
While the overall picture is bleak, there has been some progress in areas critical to reaching a deal.
Africa dramatically scaled back its expectations for climate aid from rich nations, and Japan pledged about $11 billion
(6.8 billion pound) in public funds to 2012 to help poor countries adapt to a warmer world and cut their emissions.
Talks on a U.N.-backed system to pay poorer nations to curb deforestation have advanced, and the United States
pledged $1 billion in short-term funds to conserve tropical forests.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

In the past 48 hours, the political situation in Pakistan has entered a new phase. The Supreme Court ruled the NRO
illegal and paved the way for prosecution of several government officials, most notably Interior Minister Rehman Malik.
Malik has been summoned before the Court and the Defense Minister (along with 247 other officials) was barred from
traveling to China on an official visit. Vali Nasr has been following the fast-moving and still unclear developments
closely.
In addition, the Supreme Court has opened the door to new petitions to be filed, questioning
Zardari's eligibility to have run for president in the first place. The Court could use those petitions to force Zardari from
office in the near future. It is clear that Zardari's fate will be decided by the military, which has been gaining prominence
and will be in an even stronger position after this shake-up.
In the past two days Gilani has come to Zardari's defense, suggesting the two have reached an agreement over
transfer of power from president to prime minister.

`Appointing Blair as EU president will have
consequences', warns Hague
William Hague's strident attack on his fellow Briton reportedly left some of the EU ambassadors baffled
Francis Elliott, David Charter and Tom Baldwin
William Hague has been conducting a behind-the-scenes campaign to convince European ambassadors that Tony Blair
would be a bad choice for European Union president, The Times has learnt. The Shadow Foreign Secretary used a lunch
organised by the Swedish presidency in London last week to lobby the most senior diplomats of the 26 other EU nations
against the appointment.
EU leaders had hoped to choose the new president at next week's summit, but the Czech Republic's last-minute
objections to the Lisbon treaty have scuppered that. President Sarkozy of France wants a quick decision, however, and is
understood to be pushing for a special one-day summit in Brussels next month to fill the new post.
In making the Conservatives' case against Mr Blair, Mr Hague said that while in Downing Street the former Prime Minister
had consistently placed a higher priority on US interests than on those of Europe. Mr Hague also reminded the diplomats
of Mr Blair's actions in the run-up to the Iraq war, according to one of those attending the lunch last Thursday.
A claim that Mr Hague told the ambassadors that the Tories would regard Mr Blair's appointment as a ""declaration of war""
by the EU was denied, however. A spokesman for Mr Hague said that the phrase was ""a bit strong"". Nevertheless, it was
not disputed that Mr Hague made clear that the move would have consequences for relations between Britain and
Brussels. Diplomats said that there was a ""clear mark of hostility"".
""Mr Hague wanted to leave the ambassadors in no doubt that the Conservative Party is opposed to the appointment of
Tony Blair as president of the European Council and [that] it would only underline the lack of accountability and legitimacy
involved in the creation of the position in the first place,"" Mr Hague's spokesman said. Mr Hague's strident attack on his
fellow Briton reportedly left some of the ambassadors baffled.
Mr Hague is currently in Washington for talks with members of the Obama Administration, including Hillary Clinton, the
Secretary of State, with whom he raised the issue of the Conservatives' membership of a right-wing alliance of European
parties with allegedly anti-Semitic members. He accused critics of running a smear campaign against some of the group,
led by Michal Kaminsky, head of Poland's Law and Justice Party.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

I met this morning with President Museveni in Entebbe. I raised with him the issue of the draconian

it was excessive and out of order. He said he would work with members of Parliament to revise the legislation
to make it a crime for adults to solicit or recruit minors into any homo- or heterosexual activities. Activities
between consenting adults would be stripped from the legislation. I think we rolled the worst and most

after the talks in Copenhagen ended on Saturday with a broad, non-binding accord that fell short of hopes for a robust
global agreement on how to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
Jiang was responding to a report in Britain's Guardian newspaper that said the Environment Minister Ed Miliband had
accused China, Sudan, Bolivia and other left-wing Latin American nations of ""hijacking"" efforts to reach deeper
agreement on how to fight global warming.
In a separate commentary for the paper, Miliband said China vetoed a widely supported proposal at the Copenhagen
talks to aim to cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
""We cannot again allow negotiations on real points of substance to be hijacked,"" he also wrote, but without singling out
China or any other country as a ""hijacker.""
Chinese spokeswoman Jiang did not chide Miliband by name, but Beijing's ire was clear.
""The statements from certain British politicians are plainly a political scheme,"" she said in a statement issued by the
official Xinhua news agency.
""Their objective is to shirk responsibilities that should be assumed towards developing countries, and to provoke discord
among developing countries. This scheme will come to nothing.""
The flap is unlikely to seriously disrupt negotiations seeking to turn the Copenhagen accord into a legally binding treaty.
But the sour exchange has underscored the distrust between China and rich countries that could frustrate efforts to
agree on that treaty by late 2010.
""Everyone is raising the banner of protecting the planet, but in reality they are protecting their own interests,"" Wang Vi,
a climate change policy researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, told Reuters.
""The compromises (in Copenhagen) were very, very limited.""
China is the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases from human activities and its biggest developing economy.
Other governments have pressed it to do more to reduce its growing emissions and to submit its emissions goals to
international checks as part of any new climate pact.
But China and other big developing countries have accused the rich economies of failing to offer big enough cuts to their
emissions, and of not offering enough money and technological help to poor countries to cope with climate change.
Chinese experts have also said the goal of cutting global greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050 is empty
rhetoric without those commitments from rich nations.
""Currently, the most difficult issue to resolve is the scale and structure of each country's emissions reductions,"" said Li
Zhiqing, an environmental policy professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, writing in the city's Wenhui Daily
newspaper.
""Clearly, there will be no breakthrough on this in the near term and we can only maintain the status quo,"" wrote Li.BEIJING - China condemned claims ascribed to Britain's climate change minister that it had ""hijacked"" negotiations in

Foreign Assistance and Development in a New Era
Thursday, January 28, 2010
U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar will deliver the following speech tonight at the Society for International Development's annual
dinner.
I thank the Society for International Development, its members and its leadership - Betsy Bassan and Joe Feuer - for
the work they do on development issues around the world, and for organizing this annual gala. It is unfortunate that
Chairman Kerry could not be with us tonight, but I know he shares my gratitude for your recognition.
I also want to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Shah for his remarks and to recognize the efforts of USAID and its
new Administrator in responding to the tragic earthquake in Haiti. Dr. Shah has faced one of the most challenging
crises imaginable only five days after being sworn in. The job ahead of him - in Haiti and around the globe - is
monumental. I look forward to supporting his work and that of his agency in the coming years. I commend all of our
responders from all government agencies for their courage, compassion, and skill as they continue their mission in
Haiti, and I join all of you in extending our prayers to the people of that nation.
Tonight I would like to offer a few points about where we have come from and where we might be going with regard
to U.S. investments in development.
The challenges of global poverty and hunger are growing at a time when worries about the sustainability of natural
resources are increasing. Population growth and increased affluence in some parts of the globe will require that we
more than double world food production by 2050 to keep pace. At the same time, to address environmental concerns,
we will have to harvest that food from roughly the same amount of land that is in production today. The accessibility
and availability of food deeply affects the health of populations. Childhood malnutrition has lifelong consequences for
the productivity of individuals and nations. Poverty denies opportunity to the world's young people and breeds
extremism and instability that spills over borders. It is not surprising that the CIA has long tracked and analyzed
global food supplies as an indicator of potential conflict.
There is probably not a person in this room who would disagree that development is critical for U.S. national security
and that the alleviation of poverty and hunger is a key component. This is a sentiment that is shared in most parts of
our government, including the Department of Defense.
But even though the importance of advancing development goals is evident, constructing the most efficient,
accountable, and transparent means for achieving those goals is complex and challenging. Differences of opinion exist
with regard to who should be performing development functions and how these activities should be integrated into our
broader foreign policy efforts. We have not reached a consensus within our government on who should be doing what,
where, when and why.Speech of Senator Lugar

uilding Haiti's Economy, One Mango at a Time
By PAUL COLLIER and JEAN-LOUIS WARNHOLZ
IN an astonishing outpouring of generosity, nearly half of American households have
donated money to help Haiti recover from the recent earthquake. The United States
government and other governments around the world, for their part, have sent thousands
of relief workers and have pledged 5$i billion so far. But Haitians need something more
fundamental than relief from the present situation; they need jobs that they can count on
for years ahead. For this, the private business sector is essential. Luckily, business leaders
are meeting now in Davos, Switzerland, and Haiti is prominent on their agenda.
Haiti is by far the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, and yet it need not be so,
because unexploited economic opportunities abound there. Some of the best mangoes in
the world grow in Haiti — though too many of them rot, offshore from the world's largest
market, for want of adequate roads and well-governed ports. Excellent coffee is grown in
the Haitian mountains, but much of it is sold informally across the border to coffee
producers in the Dominican Republic, who reap most of the profits.FYI — this has been in the pipeline for a while, but I understand that I am not allowed to write further articles under the

days. Mark seems to be going down the same road with all three of us. At first he knew very little about the
actual Expo but now he seems focused on the Secretary's role in bringing the USA Pavilion back to life. We all
agreed that he seems to be writing a favorable story.
He specifically wanted to know about her role and whether her ""political"" background helped her get there (
as opposed to a more traditional foreign affairs ""career"" Secretary). We thought that her political side helped
her immediately recognize that she had a real problem with the Chinese that needed to be fixed
immediately. As a problem-solving politico, she immediately went to work to fix it.
He also wanted to know if she used the WJC/HRC rolodex to raise money. We said no and noted that all of the
money is being raised in the business community and not by individuals. She did not go to her political fund-
raising base. We did not mention it but it is interesting that many of the early big sponsors were NY based
companies like GE (1
—), Pepsi ( ), Corning, Cummins, Deloitte, NYSE, and Pfizer.
He asked if S made individual calls to CEO's and we noted (as recd by L), the only general ""asks"" were done on
conference calls or in large groups. We also noted that she never really ""asked"" for sponsorships, instead she
stressed the importance of getting a formidable USA presence at the Shanghai Expo that is so important to the
Chinese and will attract 70 million people. This could be the largest event in human history and will go from
May 1 to October 31, 2010.
Talking Points
When S arrived at State, the USA and Andorra were the only two countries that did not sign a participation
agreement with the Chinese. We had less than $250,000 in the bank.
In just ten months, S assigned the Global Partnership Initiative office to lead the project, sent a signal to the
State Department bureaucracy that this was a priority and that we would participate, named a Commissioner
General, signed the participation agreement, asked Secretary Locke to break ground, raised $54.3 M to build
and operate it, and visited the actual construction site in November. The Pavilion is on target to be opened in
mid-April.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Haiti's earthquake devastated not only lives, but whatever emergency

It's a striking story of how a few tech-savvy social entrepreneurs,
receptive ears in the U.S. government and hundreds of Haitian
Creole-speaking strangers crowdsourced from around the world were able
to help people on the ground get food or medical attention.
Hours after the earthquake struck Port au Prince, 23-year-old Josh

in Sub-Saharan Africa through mobile phones, thought that an SMS
gateway would be critical in Haiti.
He sent a tweet out asking for help. A Cameroonian managing a startup
incubator in Africa, Jean Francis Ahanda, responded mentioning that a
contact, Jean-Marc Castera, was headed to the command center of the
Caribbean's largest wireless carrier Digicel that day.
Within three days, they had co-opted a shortcode, 4636, that had been
used for weather information in Haiti. They rushed to get several
other partners like Ushahidi, which provides an open-source platform
for tracking crisis communications, and Google on board. A non-profit
that specializes in using technology for disaster relief, Instedd,
built an emergency information system using the shortcode. On a very
late Saturday night, a cobbled-together team of a half-dozen
organizations or so launched '4636' as an emergency number.
They started publicizing it on the ground in Haiti through radio
stations. Haitians could text the number with messages about injuries,
people trapped under rubble or reports of missing people.Here is text

importance of the program, steps we have/will take, and acknowledgement that problems needed fixing. Sen. Casey
also put out a press release giving the Department credit for taking action adding that more action is needed and he is
encouraged ""by the new leadership of U/S McHale"" (that made me a little sad dog, but not enough to dampen my huge
relief that this is so boring to everyone!).",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Brazil is 3 hours ahead of DC
And the 1000 [our time] turnover has not yet taken place
H/W report from our first-rate senior consular officer in Brazil and then some interesting backup [in two parts]
1300 Local Time [1000 EST] Report
I have just spoken with the Brazilian Central Authority regarding the orders imminently coming out of the office of the
President of the 2nd Regional Federal Court. He is evidently interpreting the lifting of the stay imposed at STF to mean
that the 48 hour period provided in the appellate court decision to the Brazilian family to turn over Sean to the
Consulate has started ticking again — not restarted at the beginning, but resumed ticking. According to the Court, the
deadline for turnover at the Consulate falls at 6am local time on Thursday morning, December 24. Because of the early
hour, he will evidently order the family to turn over Sean at the consulate NO LATER than 9am on Thursday, December
24. However, he will also recommend, not order, that the family turn over Sean at the Consulate today/tonight in order
to permit him to travel to the U.S. on an overnight flight and spend Christmas with the family in the U.S.
There is current debate ongoing regarding the timing of the turnover. Daniel Levy of the AGU office in Rio will evidently
take the lead in negotiating that turnover, in conjunction with David's legal team.
Press contacts are stating that Sergio Tostes, the attorney for the Brazilian family, has called a press conference at 2pm
local time (11am DC time) to announce voluntary turnover. No further details oh that yet.
Will pass more information as soon as we have it. Planning for all contingencies.
BACKGROUND
o Brazilian Central Authority reports that at lam local time today, the attorney for the Brazilian family contacted
Daniel Levy, the AGU attorney representing the Brazilian Govt in this case, to inform him that the Brazilian family
is willing to arrange for voluntary turnover of Sean at the Consulate General in Rio. Daniel Levy reportedly
replied that he would only facilitate these discussions on the condition that there were no further legal",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr
3721,2010-01-30T05:00:00+00:00,"It's 745 pm -- they're still talking. British think it's reasonably positive.Welcome news. Pis keep me updated w what you hear. Thx.Here's the update, pieced together from various sources:
Starting at around 3 pm Friday, Adams and McGuinness returned to Hillsborogh to meet with Robinson and Arlene
Foster. The four talked privately for several hours and then asked for the draft papers to review. The discussion
continued until around 1 am when the parties left Hillsborough. (Foster's presence is apparently very helpful. Her
relationship with the SF leaders is much more positive and direct, treating them as equal colleagues.)
Woodward and Irish FM Martin will meet with Adams and Robinson separately this afternoon to assess where the talks
are. The talks last night/early morning ended more positively and if that is still the case there may be a decision to push
on today to see if agreement can be reached. It is equally possible that the two ministers and DUP/SF will decide to
wind up today and resume on Monday.
Brown and Cowen have spoken this morning and will speak again late this afternoon.
The issue is still parades. Robinson needs some certainity of change on parades. It is important for him politically within
the DUP, but also externally since this has become a symbol of whether he has achieved something or compromised too
much. Adams and SF have moved very far from their original positions on parades, adding that Robinson has also
moved.
The DUP linkage of the timeframes for devolution and parades is not Robinson's goal but DUP deputy party leader Nigal
Dodds. Logistically, such a linkage would be impossible without delaying devolution given that the parades framework
requires consultation, legislation, and implementation.
The role of Justice Minister and his/her relationship to the Executive has been agreed. Other issues, such as Irish
language act, N-S bodies, etc, while symbolic and emotive for SF and the nationalists community can be dealt with.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

attorneys from both sides are still negotiating the details of the handover, as is the attorney for the Government of
Brasil. According to the 2'd Regional Federal Court, the deadline for the turnover at the Consulate falls at 0600 local on
12/24. However, there may be a push to turn Sean over to the consulate today in order to permit him to travel to the

Senior Watch OfficerImportance: HighGiven the hour here, I am less optimistic that we will pull off a return tonight, but we are still working to that end.
• The Brazilian Central Authority confirms that the office of Regional Federal Court President Paulo Espirito Santo
has received the decision of STF President Gilmar Mendes. It is Paulo E-S who will be responsible for enforcing
the decision from Mendes, i.e. the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S.
• BCA has promised to reinforce for Interpol the urgent necessity of police in Rio monitoring the location of Sean
Goldman. Embassy LEGAT office is double-tracking. We cannot, of course, ask them to enforce anything until
the proper judicial authority has sent them instructions, but we strongly urge them to be prepared.
• BCA has turned over operational jurisdiction to Daniel Levy, from the AGU's office in Rio, to coordinate with
David Goldman's attorney and with the court in Rio. I have asked David's attorney to try and get some
understanding from Mr. Levy as to the timeline we can expect to see in this case.PLEASE NOTE — I am aware of the intense interest back in DC about this case and will be passing information just as soon
as I receive it. This means that in most cases, I will not be able to confirm the information. Will try to identify credible
sources vice what rumor/press/others are saying.
Brazilian Central Authority (BCA) coordinating with David's attorney and the Federal attorneys in Rio to ensure that the
President of the Regional Federal Court in Rio has a copy of the STF order and is submitting the official request to federal
police to enforce. BCA says they still believe they can effect the turnover tonight and are at their office working to that
end. If/when the Federal Police enforce, their stated preference is to go to the airport and effect the handover
there. This is a scenario we've planned for.If the family sees the writing on the wall (frankly unlikely at this point) and agrees to abide by the order of immediate
return, then in theory the handover would happen at the consulate and there is a plan in place for that.
Plans in motion to prevent them slipping away and Patricia Lamego is working with the police as we speak. Federal
Police repeatedly assured us they were prepped and ready to move but could take no action absent an order. They
know now there is one, so BCA will get them moving.
If the handover occurred tonight, I'm told we need 3 hours to get the plane off the ground, so overnight in the hotel.Marie, if there is a handover tonight: that would be at the Consulate in Rio, right? Grandparents would bring Sean and
he'd spend the night...in David's hotel or at the Consulate?
It seems very, very unlikely that will happen tonight.
But if handover is delayed until morning, the family may try to slip away tonight. Can we ask the police to prevent that?Importance: High",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Here is the message from Patricia Lamego. Heartfelt.
B6Importance: High
Dear All,
The Goldman case finally came to an end, and despite the efforts of all involved the hand over of the child to the US
Consulate in Rio was transformed into a deplorable display of the child walking in the streets with the maternal family,
being exposed to the media and to the public that surrounded the consulate.
I'm sorry this had to happen but it seems that Mr. Sergio Tostes, the matemal family's attorney, did not feel at all
embarrased to use and expose the child, who was probably under severe stress, in order to gather support for his
position. This most despicable man is not accepting the fact that, despite his life long relationships with influential
authorities in Brazil, he was unable to win the case and Sean is finally being reunited with his only real father.
(just hope that David and the Goldman family find enough time to recover their lives and their relationship with Sean.
They need time more than anything else and now it is up to the US government to guarantee that David Goldman will not
have to face the maternal family once again in the US courts where, according to Mr. Tostes last declaration to the
Brazilian press, he will ""fight to defend the child"".
Please allow David Goldman to live in peace with his son and have the life that he deserves after fighting so much for so
many years.
In my name and in the name of all the staff of the Brazilian Central Authority I wish David, Sean, and their family all the
best and a most happy life once they are finally back in the United States.
And to all of you who worked so much in support of this case, our deepest gratitude. We wish you all a Merry Christmas
and a very Happy New Year.

David Goldman, Rep Smith, David's attorneys and Mission personnel all safe at Consulate. Still set for 9am handover.
Consulate will allow Sergio Tostes, attorney for the Brazilian family, into the building along with Sean and his
grandmother, Silvana. We have arranged for the party to enter directly into the building via the garage. The
grandmother announced to the press her intention to ""park 3 blocks away, as the consulate would not allow her in"" but
press are quoting the Embassy spokesperson Orna Blum flatly contradicting that statement, emphasizing that for Sean's
emotional well-being, and in sensitivity to Silvana and David, the reunion be safe, private, and calm.
Court officials and the attorney for the GOB, Daniel Levy Alvarenga will also be at at the consulate to assist in the
turnover.

• It appears there will be no handover tonight. According to David's Brazilian attorney, the negotiators have
broken up, having not been able to agree on the issue of the Grandmother accompanying Sean to the U.S. on
the plane (clearly, the other side remains unaware of the source/nature of the charter flight that is pending a
handover). We have rebuffed attempts by the Brazilian family's attorney to ""get clarification from the
Americans"" as an obvious last-ditch ploy to once again present this as a U.S. vs Brazil issue. We have been clear
to all parties that we the Mission have absolutely no role in any negotiation between the parties and will
not/not undertake any contact with the family or their representatives.
• Deadline for handover established by the President of the 2nd Regional Federal Court in Rio remains 9am
Thursday morning at the U.S. Consulate. Brazilian Central Authority confirms that the warrant authorizing
enforcement of the order has been issued and should be in the possession of law enforcement should the family
not comply. BCA has confirmed they will be in early tomorrow morning, ready to arrange enforcement shouldImportance: High
I have just spoken with the Brazilian Central Authority regarding the orders imminently coming out of the office of the
President of the 2nd Regional Federal Court. He is evidently interpreting the lifting of the stay imposed at STF to mean
that the 48 hour period provided in the appellate court decision to the Brazilian family to turn over Sean to the
Consulate has started ticking again — not restarted at the beginning, but resumed ticking. According to the Court, the
deadline for turnover at the Consulate falls at 6am local time on Thursday morning, December 24. Because of the early
hour, he will evidently order the family to turn over Sean at the consulate NO LATER than 9am on Thursday, December
24. However, he will also recommend, not order, that the family turn over Sean at the Consulate today/tonight in order
to permit him to travel to the U.S. on an overnight flight and spend Christmas with the family in the U.S.
There is current debate ongoing regarding the timing of the turnover. Daniel Levy of the AGU office in Rio will evidently
take the lead in negotiating that turnover, in conjunction with David's legal team.
Press contacts are stating that Sergio Tostes, the attorney for the Brazilian family, has called a press conference at 2pm
local time (11am DC time) to announce voluntary turnover. No further details on that yet.
Will pass more information as soon as we have it. Planning for all contingencies.

This email is UNCLASSIFIED.Importance: HighImportance: HighGiven the hour here, I am less optimistic that we will pull off a return tonight, but we are still working to that end.
o The Brazilian Central Authority confirms that the office of Regional Federal Court President Paulo Espirito Santo
has received the decision of STF President Gilmar Mendes. It is Paulo E-S who will be responsible for enforcing
the decision from Mendes, i.e. the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S.
o BCA has promised to reinforce for Interpol the urgent necessity of police in Rio monitoring the location of Sean
Goldman. Embassy LEGAT office is double-tracking. We cannot, of course, ask them to enforce anything until
the proper judicial authority has sent them instructions, but we strongly urge them to be prepared.
• BCA has turned over operational jurisdiction to Daniel Levy, from the AGU's office in Rio, to coordinate with
David Goldman's attorney and with the court in Rio. I have asked David's attorney to try and get some
understanding from Mr. Levy as to the timeline we can expect to see in this case.PLEASE NOTE — I am aware of the intense interest back in DC about this case and will be passing information just as soon
as I receive it. This means that in most cases, I will not be able to confirm the information. Will try to identify credible
sources vice what rumor/press/others are saying.
Brazilian Central Authority (BCA) coordinating with David's attorney and the Federal attorneys in Rio to ensure that the
President of the Regional Federal Court in Rio has a copy of the STF order and is submitting the official request to federal
police to enforce. BCA says they still believe they can effect the turnover tonight and are at their office working to that
end. If/when the Federal Police enforce, their stated preference is to go to the airport and effect the handover
there. This is a scenario we've planned for.
BCA has mentioned the STJ motions filed by the Brazilian family as a potential obstacle, but thru their contacts in
Mendes' office at STF, have heard that Mendes intends to reach out to the reporting judge at STJ to resolve that
issue. As mentioned in an earlier update today, we have not had any confirmation that the STJ judge has accepted to
hear the motions filed by the Brazilian family, and has the option to decline to hear them.If the family sees the writing on the wall (frankly unlikely at this point) and agrees to abide by the order of immediate
return, then in theory the handover would happen at the consulate and there is a plan in place for that.
Plans in motion to prevent them slipping away and Patricia Lamego is working with the police as we speak. Federal
Police repeatedly assured us they were prepped and ready to move but could take no action absent an order. They
know now there is one, so BCA will get them moving.
If the handover occurred tonight, I'm told we need 3 hours to get the plane off the ground, so overnight in the hotel.Marie, if there is a handover tonight: that would be at the Consulate in Rio, right? Grandparents would bring Sean and
he'd spend the night...in David's hotel or at the Consulate?
It seems very, very unlikely that will happen tonight.
But if handover is delayed until morning, the family may try to slip away tonight. Can we ask the police to prevent that?Importance: High",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

We had asked Johnnie to address this issue based upon reports that Uganda had legislation moving up that was going to
criminalize homosexuality with the death penalty as a sanction.

My blackberry is down so I'm sending you a quick note from Uganda via Ambassador Jerry Lanier's account.
I met this morning with President Museveni in Entebbe. I raised with him the issue of the draconian legislation
proposed to criminalize homosexual activity. Museveni was unaware of the legislation but thought it was excessive and
out of order. He said he would work with members of Parliament to revise the legislation to make it a crime for adults
to solicit or recruit minors into any homo- or heterosexual activities. Activities between consenting adults would be
stripped from the legislation. I think we rolled the worst and most concerning part of this back.

Authority, the office responsible for Hague Convention abduction cases. You will see that in spite of our efforts to
protect the son, the Brazilian family chose to make a spectacle outside the Consulate this morning by parading Sean
through a crowd. Ms. Lamego recently visited the U.S. where she met with members of Congress and others to explain
all that the Brazilian Central Authority was doing to reunite Sean and his father under the Hague Convention. The
delays we saw in this case were largely the result of a wealthy, well connected family able to influence court decisions.
We are all relieved and thrilled to see this long overdue but very happy ending. I should also highlight the amazing
work done by US Mission Brazil. The consular staff, Charge, Acting DCM (Marie Damour, the Consul General in Brasilia),
LegATT, RSO, and a host of others all played a role in this successful return. My OCS DAS, Michele Bond, and her
dedicated team also played a big role in communicating with David, his lawyers, Congress, and the press. We had

As Haiti recovers, give children special attention

Given the extraordinary destruction wrought by last month's earthquake

I would encourage you to take note of this Newsweek interview posted today in which US Global AIDS
Coordinator Eric Goosby makes what could well be a significant diplomatic and human rights blunder..
Ambassador Goosby, according to Newsweek, says that he does not have a dog in the fight as to whether
Uganda criminalizes or even adopts the death penalty for homosexuality. ..Goosby.s interview appears to
undercut the pressure the Congress, the Secretary of State and human rights supporters around the world have
put on the Ugandan government in recent days to save the LGBT population in that country from violent
persecution.. The LGBT worldwide community must push back against any leader, including Goosby if the
Newsweek report is accurate, who looks the other way as Uganda enacts a draconian law to imprison or even
execute its LGBT citizens.

goals
With President Barack Obama coming to Miami, some Haitian-American activists want
him to address the issue of Temporary Protected Status.
BY LESLEY CLARK AND JACQUELINE CHARLES
LCLARK@MIAMIHERALD.COM
WASHINGTON -- Haitian-American and immigrant activists who greeted President Barack Obama's election with
high hopes are growing frustrated with the administration's failure to deliver one of their top goals.
Obama said in July he was ""very sympathetic"" to the community's request to allow Haitian immigrants now illegally
in the country to stay temporarily, but no decision has been announced. Some activists say their patience is wearing
thin.
""I feel they are stringing us along, and we are in an awkward position,"" said Randolph McGrorty, head of Catholic
Charities Legal Services, who brought the subject to a head with a stinging e-mail sent to House, Senate and
administration staffers last week. ""Do we allow them to string us along because they are our allies or do we start
calling them on the carpet for it?""
The unrest comes as Obama plans a trip to Miami on Monday to raise money for House and Senate Democrats.
Presidential candidate Obama did not promise to grant undocumented Haitian immigrants temporary legal status in
the United States -- a designation known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS -- but activists said they believed
the first African-American president would give the issue special consideration.
Instead, former President Bill Clinton -- a United Nations special envoy to the country -- and the United Nations have
taken the lead in rebuilding a storm-battered Haiti after last year's four back-to-back storms that killed hundreds and
left nearly $1 billion in damages.
CHALLENGE
The issue of TPS poses a challenge for Rep. Kendrick Meek, a Miami Democrat who is depending on a robust
tumout in the politically active Haitian-American community to boost his Senate bid. But critics say South Florida's
congressional Democrats, including Meek, have not been as vocal about pushing the Obama administration on Haiti
as they were during the Bush administration.
Meek, who represents the largest group of Haitian-American voters in the United States, said Friday he's had
meetings with the administration and is optimistic that it is taking a serious look at the policy.Haitian activists want Obama to address immigration

has no plans to visit Iran.""

He said they are waiting for the judge to sign the paper with the stipulation that someone remains in country to answer
questions. Their understanding is that that person can be the atty.By Joseph Guyler Delva
PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - A Haitian judge said Thursday he had ruled in favor of the release of 10
U.S. missionaries accused of kidnapping 33 children and trying to take them out of the earthquake-stricken
country.
""I just signed the request for the release of the 10 Americans submitted by the lawyers and I have sent it to
the prosecutor's office,"" Judge Bernard Sainvil said.
He earlier told Reuters that once the prosecutor had given his opinion, he could formally issue a release order
for the Americans, who have been jailed since they were stopped at Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic
on Jan. 29.
Once the release order was issued, ""they can go directly to the airport if they want and leave, but they should
provide a guarantee of representation if further questions need to be asked,"" Sainvil said.
Under Haitian law, the prosecutor can formally comment on the judge's decision but he cannot overrule it.
A judicial source told Reuters Wednesday that Sainvil had decided to free the U.S. missionaries because
there had been no evidence demonstrating ""criminal intentions"" on their part to support charges of child kidnap
and criminal association leveled against them.
The missionaries, most of whom belong to an Idaho-based Baptist church, were arrested trying to take the
children across the border to the Dominican Republic 17 days after a magnitude 7 earthquake that killed more
than 200,000 people in the impoverished Caribbean nation.
PLEAS FOR RELEASE FROM PARENTS
The five men and five women have denied any intentional wrongdoing and said they were only trying to
help orphans left destitute by the quake, which shattered the Haitian capital and left more than 1 million
homeless. But evidence showed that most of the children still had living parents.
During hearings in the case, Sainvil heard from 10 parents of children handed over to the Americans. They",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

implement. We have begun to roll-out the new plan and so far the reaction has been reasonably positive. We have
organized a set of working groups around key initiatives --- women's empowerment; cve; expanded English language
training; cultural programming; youth; climate change; etc so that we can incorporate new proposals into FY2012
budget and re-direct FY 2010 and 2011 funds wherever possible and appropriate. The working groups are being chaired
by senior level officers from the regional bureaus --- Bob Blake; Craig Kelly, etc. --- and are being asked to report back
within 4 to 6 weeks. I'll continue to keep you posted as things move forward.
The New Public Diplomacy
Joseph S. Nye
2010-02-10
CAMBRIDGE — The world of traditional power politics was typically about whose military or economy would
win. In today's information age, politics is also about whose ""story"" wins.
National narratives are, indeed, a type of currency. Governments compete with each other and with other
organizations to enhance their own credibility and weaken that of their opponents. Witness the contest between
the government and protesters after the Iranian elections in June 2009, in which the Internet and Twitter played
crucial roles, or the recent controversy between Google and China.
Reputation has always mattered in world politics, but credibility has become crucial because of a ""paradox of
plenty."" When information is plentiful, the scarce resource is attention. Under the new conditions, a soft sell
may, more than ever, prove more effective than a hard sell.
For example, the relative independence of the BBC, sometimes a source of consternation to British
governments, has paid rich dividends in credibility, as illustrated by this account of Tanzanian President Jakaya",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Speaking too softly

From Economist.com
Relations between America and China may chill over a meeting with the Dalai Lama
AP
IT IS bound to be a controversial meeting. The Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, goes to Washington,
DC, this week and will sit down with President Barack Obanna for the first time on Thursday February 18th.
American presidents have long been happy to meet the Tibetan leader and to tolerate subsequent angry
huffing from China, not least as a means of responding to public concern over human rights without doing
anything serious to jeopardise trade or other ties with Beijing.
But in Mr Obama's case, with China increasingly assertive internationally and the American president
perceived in many quarters as cautious, even timid, in foreign policy, the encounter with the Dalai Lama
has assumed extra significance. Mr Obama will be studied closely. Human-rights activists will listen with
care to the language that the American president uses, straining to hear whether he goes further than
merely suggesting more dialogue between Tibetans and the Chinese leadership. Might the president dare
to deliver real criticism of repression and human-rights abuses in Tibet?
Kenneth Roth, the head of Human Rights Watch, an activist group in New York, offers a mixed assessment
of Mr Obama's foreign policy so far in its treatment of human rights. He suggests that no other recent
American leader has taken such care with his rhetoric, judging how it is received by the rest of the world.
But substantial steps too rarely follow Mr Obama's fine words. The president's speeches—as in Cairo last
year—have helped to set a conciliatory tone for American foreign policy, and to reassure Muslims and

fairly provocative way and the guests, who come from across the political spectrum, respond. As you can
see, the first commentator is strongly anti US. However, what I, have observed since our media offensive
began last Fall is that there is usually a more moderate guest as well, who will argue along the lines that it is
only natural for the US to protect its interests and GOP should do a better job of protecting Pakistan. Believe it
or not there have even been instances where we get credit for some of the things we do. Also on occasion

PLAYA DEL CARMEN, Mexico, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- Heads of state or government from the Caribbean region on Sunday
called for the earthquake disaster in Haiti to be a spur for the rebirth of the nation, during the opening session of the
first Mexico-Caricom Summit in Playa del Carmen, a resort city on Mexico's Caribbean coast.
""First on our agenda is Haiti,"" said Roosevelt Skerrit, the prime minister of Dominica and leader of the Caricom (the
Caribbean Community) until July. ""We want to ensure reconstruction goes beyond immediate efforts. We have an
opportunity to bring about the renaissance of Haiti, not just to return to where we were before the disaster struck.""
On Jan. 12, Haiti was struck by an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale, which killed at least 200,000 people
and destroyed numerous homes, workplaces, infrastructure and government buildings.
Mexican President Felipe Calderon, who formally opened the summit on Sunday afternoon, said Haiti would be a top
priority, adding that the summit would also discuss boosting trade and growth across the Caribbean region, protecting
and developing tourism, boosting regional security, and tackling climate change. He said that Mexico was committed to
the region.
""Mexico is a nation that is Caribbean nation, powerfully Caribbean,"" Calderon said. ""As such Mexico takes on its
responsibility of participating actively in the region's development.""
During his speech, Haitian President Rene Preval said that as many as 300,000 people may have died in the devastating
quake last month.
""More than 200,000 bodies have been recovered from the streets, (and) with those under the rubble that figure could
reach 300,000, "" he said. Preval also thanked the host Mexico for all the aid it had provided for Haiti's earthquake
victims.
""Haiti's friends realize that Haiti's true development cannot be built on aid, but must be based on investment,"" Preval
said, adding that the nation needs ""not rebuilding but refounding.""
""We need a more just nation that is not focused on Port-au- Prince where the political and economic elite live,"" he
stressed.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Republican dissidents suspected after blast outside courthouse in Newry as evacuation was taking place

• Article history
A car bomb exploded last night outside the courthouse in Newry, Northern Ireland, police said. There were no initial
reports of any injuries in the blast.
Police said the vehicle was abandoned at the front of the building in the Co Down town at around lOpm. Officers were in
the process of evacuating the area when the car exploded.
Suspicion is bound to fall on republican dissidents opposed to the peace process. The incident comes only days after a
mortar bomb failed to detonate outside a police station in the nearby Co Armagh village of Keady.
The chairman of the nationalist SDLP in Newry, Gary McKeown, condemned those responsible. ""Lives could have been
lost as a result of this bombing,"" he said. ""It serves absolutely no purpose and does nothing for the community, or the
cause of a united Ireland. If people want to advance their beliefs, they should enter the democratic process and debate
with their political opponents, rather than resorting to violence. Planting bombs outside courthouses will achieve nothing.""
Earlier this month, police on both sides of the Irish border launched separate operations against dissident republicans.
Police in Northern Ireland arrested two men and a woman in connection with the murder of Constable Stephen Carroll, the
first PSNI officer killed by terrorists in the province.
The Continuity IRA shot the 48-year-old policeman dead on a housing estate in Craigavon, County Armagh, on 9 March
last year. His murder came just 48 hours after the Real IRA killed two British soldiers outside the Massereene barracks in
Antrim. In September police discovered a massive 600lb bomb in the south Armagh village of Forkhill.
On Sunday, Republican Sinn Fein, political allies of the Continuity IRA, claimed masked undercover soldiers carried out
surveillance on two housing estates in Lurgan, Co Armagh, in recent weeks. They claimed the men were scouting the
areas in white civilian vans. Republican Sinn Fein said the soldiers belonged to the Special Reconnaissance Regiment.
The alleged presence of SRR soldiers — formerly known as the 14th Intelligence Unit — is controversial because British
troops are meant to have been pulled off the streets, especially in nationalist areas.

Haitian senators want to oust the country's prime minister, clad ing

PORT-AU-PRINCE -- With Haiti poised to enjoy the economic benefits of long-elusive stability, foreign
diplomats are scrambling behind the scenes to keep it all from unraveling as several lawmakers derhand the
ouster of the country's prime minister.
A small but powerful group of senators is seeking the removal of Prime Minister Miche&grave;le Pierre-Louis --
and possibly several of her ministers -- on charges that she has moved too slowly to solve Haiti's problems.
""The situation is critical,"" said Sen. Jean Hector Anacasis, who is among the six senators behind a recent
summons for Pierre-Louis to appear before Haiti's Senate on Thursday. Under Haiti's constitution, the Senate
can fire a sitting government.
""We are the ones on the ground who hear the people's cry, who hear them criticizing us, the government,
saying nothing has been done. We have to replace the woman,"" Anacasis said. ""If they are accusing us of
inviting a crisis, then we are inviting a crisis to avert another crisis.""
The internal political maneuvering comes just three weeks after former U.S. President and U.N. Special Envoy
to Haiti Bill Clinton led a historic trade mission here, triggering optimism that this land of seemingly missed

Obama Advisers to Aid Tories' Election TV
Battle
By IAIN MARTIN
Advisers close to U.S. President Barack Obama have been drafted by David Cameron to help the Conservatives in their
election campaign against Gordon Brown and Labour.
The Tories have signed a contract with Squier, Knapp, Dunn Communications—a Washington-based Democrat-leaning
political consultancy— to help them prepare for the first-ever television debates between leaders during a British election
camialin.
David Cameron
The firm also is expected to offer some advice more broadly to the Tory leader on the Conservative campaign in the lead-
up to voting, likely to take place on May 6.
Opinion polls have suggested a narrowing of the gap between the two main parties—with the Conservative lead cut to six
to seven points in the two most recent polls earlier this week.
A Conservative spokesman confirmed Wednesday night that Squier, Knapp, Dunn will act as consultants for the television
debates.
Anita Dunn, one of the firm's senior partners, was hired by Mr. Obama in 2006 ahead of his run for president and was the
communications director at the White House until November. Bill Knapp, another senior partner and veteran of the
successful Obama campaign, is a close adviser to the mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg.
Tory campaign insiders say they have been talking to the firm for several months after a recommendation from Mayor
Bloomberg, who retains close links with the British Tory leadership.
He was a lifelong Democrat who switched to the Republicans when he first ran for mayor.
The British general election is taking on a particularly American flavor, with the prime minister also understood to be
seeking advice from a consultant based in the U.S. The Times of London reported that Joel Benenson, a polling and
strategy adviser who worked on the team that readied Mr. Obama for the American TV debates, is helping Mr. Brown.
None of the British parties has experience of leaders' debates and as a consequence are looking outside for help.
However, it is the decision of the Tories to reach out across the traditional ideological divide to senior Democrats that is
surprising. Their party usually has looked to Republican strategists for advice, with Labour and the Democrats retaining
close links.
Ms. Dunn is a veteran of Democrat politics, beginning her career in Jimmy Carter's administration and subsequently
working as a consultant on many election campaigns. She returned to the White House with President Obama but left late",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Hi Judith—I am due to speak momentarily to Times editor James Harding on the cartoon. It's
disgusting and completely unfair.
On overall Afghanistan coverage, Embassy London is also concerned. We engage every day on
this topic, either through briefings, interviews with policy makers coming through (recent
highlight was a brilliant interview by Newsnight's Paxman with Holbrooke), facilitating media
enbeds and reporting on the ground, making and pushing out speeches, discussions with
journalists. We work closely with colleagues in Kabul, NATO and elsewhere. We get decent
support from Washington and other field elements, although sometimes we struggle to get basic
information from our colleagues, such as total number of troops involved in Operation
Moshtarak.
One challenge for us is that we are tightly bound here in the public mind to HMG on this
issue. And in the run-up to the UK election, some media outlets see criticism of the effort in
Afghanistan as an effective way to campaign against Gordon Brown. Sometimes they ricochet a
shot off of us in order to hit the main target. The Murdoch outlets, of which the Times is one,
have a headline goal of getting Cameron elected, which is what
told me outright earlier this week. This cartoon was possibly one of those ricochet shots, but
that sure doesn't excuse it. Thanks for your note—I really appreciate you thinking of us. We
will continue to fight hard and we'll rely on your support.

This morning, media note the latest ""Suicide attack on Afghan capital""(BBC on-line).
La Stampa on-line says the ""Safi Hotel, where foreigners stay, was targeted.... The attack [comes] as India-
Pakistan negotiations resume."" France 24 TV comments, ""What needs to be understood is that this is a nine-
level hotel in which all the windows exploded, up to the very top of the hotel, which proves how powerful the
explosion was. Afghan policemen are very nervous."" Meanwhile, print media report the ""Afghan government
hoists flag over Taliban stronghold Marjah"" (Dutch daily Trouw). Dziennik Gazeta Prawna notes that locals
""testify that most of the Taliban withdrew from Marja without fighting, and they will try to return when the U.S.
forces leave the area."" The Independent says that ""despite victories in the Marjah offensive, Afghans worry that
militants have lived to fight another day."" Other coverage notes civilian casualties. A day after leading with the
story that ""NATO admits that deaths of 8 boys were a mistake,"" The Times runs a large editorial cartoon
showing U.S. soldiers in the pose of the Iwo Jima memorial, hoisting the Afghan flag into the bloody body of an

The political timing on the EU presidency is accelerating. Sarkozy and Merkel are meeting
tonight (October 18) to discuss it. The Czech constitutional court will issue its verdict on the
legality of the Lisbon treaty on November 3. Shortly after, perhaps that week, before you meet
with Merkel on November 8-9, there may be an EU Council meeting to decide the matter. So
you may want to weigh in before then.
Tony is somewhat downcast on his chances. (He met with Jim Hoagland of the Washington Post
yesterday; his mood was described to me.) The Tories have ramped up their campaign against
him—not only do they not want him but they also do not want an effective EU president.
Cameron has come down on the side of the anti-EU wing of his party on this, an easy move. In
an intriguing complication, there's talk now of David Miliband becoming EU foreign secretary if
Tony does not become EU president. Miliband denied he was interested and endorsed Tony. This
is part of the anti-Blair campaign ginned up by the Tories, extended to hurt Miliband if they can.
Jonathan Powell is less gloomy than Tony, thinks everything is still in play, which is why your
part in this may yet be important.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

From The Times
January 18, 2010
Fear of the poor is hampering Haiti rescue
American views rule among the rubble of Port-au-Prince.
That's one reason aid is taking so long to get to those in need
Linda Polman
Aid workers have already baptised the earthquake in Haiti a ""historical disaster"". It will rate high in the annals of the
humanitarian aid world because of the number of victims and scale of the destruction. But the rescue operation is also
becoming notorious for the slowness with which aid is reaching the victims. Five days after the quake hit, many places are
still largely bereft of international aid.
Not through lack of funds, supplies or emergency experts. Those are all pouring in from dozens of countries. But most of
the aid — and aid workers — seems stuck at the airport.
Rescue teams have pulled survivors from five-star hotels, university buildings, a supermarket and the UN headquarters,
all in Port-au-Prince's better neighbourhoods. In poor areas, where the damage appears much greater, apparently
forgotten victims report on Twitter that they have yet to encounter the first foreign rescuer.
Many aid workers are reported to have orders not to venture out without armed guards — which are not there at all, or
only after long debates with the UN military command. The UN has lost a number of staff in the quake, and is not keen to
risk more lives.
But the Haitian people seem to scare aid workers more than Somali warlords, Darfuri Janjawid or Afghan Taleban.
Frightened Dutch aid workers abandoned a mission without•reaching the collapsed building where people were trapped,
and frightened doctors have left their patients unattended.
The experience of CNN's medical reporter, Dr Sanjay Gupta, is telling. In a makeshift clinic he encountered a Belgian
medical team being evacuated in a UN bus. UN ""rules of engagement"" apparently stopped them providing security for the
doctors. The Belgians took most of their medical supplies with them, to keep them out of the claws of robbers.
Dr Gupta and his camera team stayed the night, monitored the abandoned patients' vital signs and continued intravenous
drips — and they were not robbed. Some rescuers are leaning so much toward security that they will allow people to die.
The media are not helping. CNN rules in the rubble. ""Outside of a military conflict, this is our biggest international
deployment since the tsunami in 2004,"" according to Tony Maddox, the managing director of CNN International. So the
image of the aid operation being beamed back is primarily Ameridan — and one of the big problems is the American view
of Haiti.
CNN won't stop telling aid workers and the outside world about pillaging (the incidence of which — for the first four
frustrating days at least — did not compare with what happened after Hurricane Katrina) and about how dangerous it is to
distribute food, because of the likelihood of ""stampedes"".
Nor is the US Government, the biggest player in the aid operation, doing anything to help to relax the atmosphere. On the
contrary. When President Obama said that the US aid effort would be ""aggressive"" he meant it. The humanitarian
operation is not led by civilian agencies, but by the Pentagon.
Mr Obama ordered 9,000 troops and a fleet of nuclear-powered ships to move in. Victims of the war in Congo (which has
cost five million lives in the past years) and of the genocide in Darfur would love so much American attention — but it is
Haiti's fate to lay in America's backyard and to have been a sore to American eyes for decades already.
One, perhaps even two million Haitians already live in the United States, but more try to come. Every day dead Haitian
refugees wash up on Miami's sunny beaches. Haiti is a constant pain for US taxpayers who feel that the billions of dollars",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr cheryl.mills@univ-tlse3.fr

Without passing ""Go,"" David Cameron has seriously damaged his relations with the European
leaders. Sending a letter to Czech leader Vaclav Klaus encouraging him not to sign the Lisbon
Treaty, as though Cameron were already Prime Minister, he has offended Sarkozy, Merkel and
Zapatero. Within the Conservative Party the Shadow Foreign Minister William Hague has
arduously pressured for an anti-EU stance, despite his assurances to you that Tory policy toward
Europe would be marked by continuity. Cameron has attempted to straddle factions, fending off
calls for a national referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. But this letter is proof positive of his tilt to
the Tory right on Europe. The European leaders understand that the letter signals his future .
policy and are reacting accordingly. Cameron's presumptive strike has accelerated the predicted
Tory-European split from post-election to pre-election. Whether this affects Merkel's attitude on
Blair and the EU presidency remains unclear, but Cameron's high-handed behavior is precisely",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

water in December outlining our plans. Note that we are mandated to report to Congress annually as part of the ""Water

I have met with Kerri-Ann, with OES ""water"" staff in the last weeks to address this and also with several regional bureau

There is a great deal of interest on their part and we have started outlining specific initiatives that we could focus on.
We've also met on the Nile Basin Initiative, with World Bank ""experts"" leading NGOs, McKinsey, etc. I've also spoken to
Raj (USAID allocated about $480 million in FY 2009 to water, and MCC about $500 million) but of course he has been
unable to focus on this. And Cheryl and I haven't spoken yet about Food Security/water.Maria, Anne-Marie and Cheryl,

largest city in Chile about 400 miles south of Santiago (city of Cauquenes--- hardest hit).
Just heard Bachelet on TV-- casualties so far 16-- though because communications down and it is still dark information is
preliminary. Some concern over risk of Tsunami though Navy deems unlikely. Fortunately, there is no collapse of dams.
Considerable damage to highway bridges and infrastructure--that will affect traffic-- in Talca hospital evacuated for
precautionary reasons. President declared zones of Maule and Bio Bio disaster areas.
Significant loss of life and damage unlikely because Chile suffered devastating earthquakes in 1939 and 1960 (the
strongest in recorded history) in same area so most old construction is gone. Chile has strong construction codes and
state of the art anti-earthquake standards. Also Chile has excellent first responder capacity. One concern of course are
aftershocks. In 1960 (May 21) a second earthquake occurred day after that caused a Tsunami in Japan.
Will have to evaluate whether trip to Chile should proceed. Precisely because of tragedy this may not be time to cancel -
- provided Chilean side can handle and are anxious for trip to proceed. Suspect that that will be the case. Should
evaluate in morning after dust settles.

Dave,
According to the Agricultural Agreement between Israel and the US from 2004 (ATAP), carp is not exempted
from custom duties. Last December the Israeli customs realized that according to the tariff list their is no
customs on the importation of carp to Israel. That was amended. A few weeks ago a representative of the
relevant company in Illinois contacted our trade mission to inquire about the new customs tariff and was told
that it would apply to all the carp his company will send to Israel. Therefore it should not have been a surprise
to the company this new customs tariff. Their are now 2 containers of the fish that are sitting in the port in Israel
waiting to be cleared and their are another 7 containers waiting in Illinois to get the green light to leave for
Israel. Our trade representative here thinks he could get an exemption for the two containers already in Israel
from the new customs tariff but probably not for the other 7. We at the embassy have asked he highest political
level in Israel to see if we could get an exemption from customs for all the 9 containers.
Sent via BlackBerry by AT&THi Daniel-We're not just concerned about customs, but would like to understand what the issue is preventing delivery.
Thanks. DaveUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767719 Date: 08/31/2015Hi Daniel-Sony to bother you on shabbat, but during yesterday's hearing with the Secretary, Rep Manzullo he asked her to help soert

Gordon Brown on course to win election
David Smith and Jonathan Oliver
GORDON BROWN is on course to remain prime minister after the general election as a new Sunday Times poll reveals
that Labour is now just two points behind the Tories.
The YouGov survey places David Cameron's Conservatives on 37%, as against 35% for Labour — the closest gap
between the parties in more than two years.
It means Labour is heading for a total of 317 seats, nine short of an overall majority, with the Tories languishing on a total
of just 263 MPs. Such an outcome would mean Brown could stay in office and deny Cameron the keys to No 10.
The poll result presents the Conservative leader with one of the greatest challenges of his leadership today as he makes
the keynote speech to his party's spring forum.

Hello and Happy New Year Jim,
Friends of WFP has decided to provide its annual ""Leadership in the Fight Against Hunger"" Award to Secretary Clinton
this year. The award is presented at a ceremony on Capitol Hill (within one of the House/Senate caucus rooms).
Approximately 200 people attend the event including Members of Congress, NGO representatives, business leaders,
administration officials and other leaders in the fight against hunger.
As you know, Friends of WFP is a non-profit organization dedicated to addressing global hunger. Its board members
include former agriculture secretary Dan Glickman, former Senators George McGovern and Bob Dole, YUM Brands CEO
David Novak, former NSC Advisor Sandy Berger and others. I established the organization in 1997.Friends,
As 2009 comes to a close, we wanted to provide you with an update on the U.S. Global Hunger and Food Security
Initiative and share with you what is to come in the new year.
First, a word of thanks for the input that many of you provided on our Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative
consultation document. We received a large amount of interest and excellent suggestions on the document, and we will
soon release a new version that reflects this input.
We are also drafting an implementation plan that will describe in greater detail how we intend to implement the
initiative. We look forward to sharing both documents with you.
In recent months, we have continued to garner international support for the five core principles for global food security
that form the basis of our strategy. In November, all UN member states endorsed these principles at the World Summit
on Food Security in Rome.
1)Invest in country-owned plans
2)Foster strategic coordination
3) Strive for a comprehensive approach to food security",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

say absolutely no for months (Qualcomm, Bloomberg, J&J) and then pop out of nowhere and say yes. Others like All are

We WILL raise the money. We are at $54M+ (this wk Hawaii came in for $500k and Bloomberg LLC and need $7M

There weren't a huge number of updates over the evening, though the phones are getting more active again now. Late
this morning we learned that SYG Ban Ki Moon was in touch with AMB Rice, and told her that there were approximately
100 UN staff still buried under the rubble at MINUSTAH, SYG Ban formally requested
helicopter search and rescue teams. AMB Rice underscored that we need to make getting those SARs a priority.
I'm attaching our draft talking points from about an hour and a half ago; the background sections in particular have
some useful information. Currently, Southcom is conducting aerial reconnaissance of the airport to determine in what
sort of repair it is. The talking points note that several countries and organizations (Dominican Republic, Chile, UK, the
Netherlands, IADB) have offered assistance to Haiti (and info'd us). In addition to those on the list, the Israelis are trying
to send several urban search and rescue teams (some of the team members need help getting visas to transit Miami en
route to Port-au-Prince).
The UN Situation Center is in contact with MINUSTAH's Deputy Force Commander. They have been working to clear a
couple of major streets in Port-au-Prince, as noted in the talking points. They have also reviewed the airport, and their
Deputy Force Commander told the UN Situation Center several hours ago that the airport was functional (in the sense
that the tarmac was intact and planes could physically land).
Oren Anolik, political counselor at the Israeli Embassy, called around 2 a.m. to ask if there were any updates. We had
few updates at that time, other than to let him know that we had learned the damage to southern Haiti was much more
extensive than that in the north.

Rashad Hussain, a Muslim and new U.S. envoy, is bridge between two
worlds
By Scott Wilson
Monday, March 1, 2010; A19
Rashad Hussain, President Obama's new special envoy to the Organization of the Islamic Conference, was an
avid high school debater in Plano, Tex., where he grew up.
His debate partner and best friend was a classmate named Josh Goldberg, meaning that at the end of many
tournaments, the judge would announce ""Goldberg-Hussain"" as the cultural odd couple who had won the
argument. ""People got a kick out of it,"" Hussain said in a recent interview. ""We joked that one day we would
have the solution to the peace process."" The two remain close friends.
In his new position, Hussain, who is both a Koran scholar and an ardent North Carolina Tar Heels basketball
fan, will be responsible for helping to bridge another cultural divide -- the one in U.S. relations with Muslims
inside and outside the nation's borders.
Since taking office, Obama has adopted an approach to broaden the ways in which the United States engages
the Islamic world, moving from a policy focused mostly on counterterrorism to one that includes partnerships
with Muslim countries and communities in education, health, science and commerce.
Hussain, 31, will be the face of that policy in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, where the Islamic Conference has it
headquarters, and in the other capitals of its 56 member countries. His is an appropriately young face for an
American representative to the world's 1.6 billion Muslims, the majority of whom are younger than he is.
At a time when the United States is fighting two wars in Muslim nations and defending itself against an
enduring terrorist threat, changing perceptions will take time. ""The challenge is to continue to communicate that
this is a long-term process,"" Hussain said. ""Sometimes the challenge becomes that people want to focus
exclusively on the political issues, issues that this administration is working very diligently to solve.""
Hussain's father, a mining engineer, moved from Bihar, India, to Wyoming in the late 1960s. A few years later,
during a visit to India, he married Hussain's mother, now an obstetrician in Plano.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

information on the ground, with a valuable independent perspective. She is very tuned into the government's
cornmunications challenges and opportunities.
In her view, while the need is more urgent than ever, the government does have positive programs and policies that
would generate good will if people knew about them. Communications seems to suffer both from a lack of perspective -
politicians are obsessed with politics in the capital, rather than the needs of people at the grassroots - and a lack of both
practical expertise and proactive strategy. They need a plan for publicizing initiatives that benefit people, as well as
hands-on training and support to execute effectively.
This sounds very similar to the situation my team dealt with in Lebanon, where we worked with the government,
political parties and NG0s. We learned not to let a state of crisis be an obstacle to moving forward with a
communications program - they're always in crisis and, as you know, effective communications is part of the long-term
solution.
I know there may be concern about working with US consultants. One approach would be to work through NDI, which
has great contacts and credibility on the ground. That's how we did it in Lebanon.
I hope some of this is useful food for thought. You may recall that, when we met before the holidays, I showed you the
program we did in Lebanon. Would you like me to put together ideas for a program in Pakistan?

4332,2010-03-02T05:00:00+00:00,"Madam Secretary-
A few very quick notes for your visit here.
-- Chileans of all stripes are still recovering physically and emotionally from
this earthquake.
Bachelet's team initially underestimated the devastation in the affected
area, but have moved quickly in the past 24 hours to restore public order
which remains a major challenge.
While Santiago looks superficially normal, there is still a huge cleanup
effort ahead in the city and emotions are running high. Restoring
services to Concepcion, Maule and the other affected areas will take
weeks if not months. Without electricity there is no water or
telecommunications.
Chileans are proud and reluctant to accept much external support for the
recovery effort. While they have grudgingly opened up to international
offers of assistance, their wish list is short, and limited to very specific
items. I believe they need to be much more expansive in their outreach
to the international community. But this is a hard sell.
With Bachelet, you should express condolences, review current and
pending U.S. support, and seek out her views on how we can be most
helpful moving forward. You should also compliment her on her social
legacy and her record of leadership in the region. If there is time, you",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Casualties and damage from the earthquake are so extensive that overall assessments are still incomplete. UN
assistance to the victims has been complicated by the fact that a significant number of UN personnel, including
UNDP colleagues, serving in the country are unaccounted for. The headquarters of the UN Mission and
peacekeeping operations, MINUSTAH, collapsed in the tremors and many people are still trapped inside.
UNDP Administrator Helen Clark is meeting with the Secretary-General and other senior personnel continually
today and the whole UN system is mobilized to bring the UN team in Haiti all necessary assistance as soon as
possible to assess the damage, loss of life and injuries, and to support the national and international response
efforts.
The building which housed UNDP and a large number of sister agencies - UNFPA, WFP, UNEP and UNIFEM
- was partially damaged, and rescue workers are continuing to search through the rubble. Senior UNDP officials
are in close touch with the Resident Co-ordinator, Kim Bolduc, who is operating out of a MlNUSTAH logistics
base near the airport. She reports that the situation is critical for staff with limited access to food, water,
sanitation and medical attention.
In the coming hours UNDP will be dispatching additional staff, including stress counselors and medical doctors,
as well communications equipment, to Port-au-Prince. Arrangements are also being made to evacuate injured
and non-essential staff out from the country and to care for and assist its many local staff members. Due to the
limited logistics capacity in Haiti, most of the staff and equipment needed will be transiting through the
Dominican Republic. Plans for strengthening the UNDP office in that country are already underway.
Administrator Clark says UNDP will do whatever it can to support its staff in Haiti and to equip them with the
necessary tools to help the Haitian people on what will be a long road to recovery. As a first step she expects a
UN emergency response team lead by UN Office of the Coordinator for Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA) to be
on the ground shortly to help co-ordinate humanitarian relief efforts.

democratically; one had to govern democratically. He reviewed his own performance applying the Inter-American
Democratic Charter (IADC) over the past five years and concluded that the record was good. He conceded that he had
intervened too late in the Honduras case but said that was because Zelaya waited until too late to extend the invitation,
asserting that he cannot intervene without an invitation from the executive branch.
""The truth is that we did everything possible to restore democracy in Honduras,"" he said.
Insulza said the Honduras experience showed the OAS needs to develop ""swifter and more flexible procedures"" to allow
it to respond more preemptively. This would include mechanisms for the OAS to ""make itself present in countries where
there are possible signs of instability.""
Insulza committed to ""unreserved support"" for the OAS human rights mechanisms, while respecting their autonomy.
""Democracy is more than elections and includes such essential components as respect for human rights, freedom of
expression, separation and independence of the branches of government, respect for the rule of law and the democratic
institutional system, and transparency and honesty in government. It also establishes a link between democracy,
development, and equity,"" he said.
He talked about ""modern multilateralism,"" modeled on the EU, as his vision for the OAS. ""Modern multilateralism,"" he
said, eschews Cold War divisions and ""we all work together to build on our common principles.""
On the management side, Insulza claimed he had inherited a bad financial situation at the OAS and improved it.
Nonetheless, he said, ""we need more resources."" He committed to seek them from non-traditional sources such as OAS
observers, NG0s, the private sector and academia. He claimed his efforts to improve transparency and accountability
had been commended by external auditors.Could one of you or your minions take this on? .

This is going out as a cable momentarily. The main point is that the crash killed not only the President and his wife but a
broad swath of Poland's top national security leadership. In this sense it is an unprecedented governmental tragedy,
and a test of Poland's constitution. The sitrep follows.
Shortly before 1000 Warsaw time, a Polish government Tu-154 plane carrying a delegation headed by Polish President
Lech Kaczynski crashed in heavy fog at the airport in Smolensk, Russia. Russian officials have told the press that there
were no survivors; the foreign ministry spokesman said there were 88 passengers on board. The delegation was en
route to ceremonies hosted by the Russian government to commemorate the 70t1, anniversary of the Katyn
massacres. There is as yet not government confirmation of the deaths, but there is no expectation of survivors.
Speaker of the Polish Sejm (the lower house of parliament) Bronislaw Komorowski is en route to Warsaw to take over
the powers of the presidency and those of the Commander in Chief, according to press reports. According to the Polish
constitution, if the president dies in office, the Speaker temporarily assumes the presidency, and has 14 days to
announce the date of special presidential elections. The elections must be held within 60 days of his
announcement. This is the first major test of the Polish constitution, and the government is itself sorting out the details
of the procedure in this unprecedented circumstance.

WASHINGTON, April 10, 2010 (AFP) - Cuba's leadership does not want to normalize ties with Washington because they
would ""lose their excuses"" for the country's economic stagnation, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday.
The United States maintains a decades-old trade embargo on the Americas' only one-party Communist regime, but
President Barack Obama took office last year offering to improve ties if President Raul Castro improved human rights.
Clinton however blamed Castro and his brother Fidel -- Cuba's leader from 1959 to 2008 -- for undermining
Washington's bid to improve relations.
Despite US efforts to ""enhance cooperation,"" Clinton said that the Castro brothers ""do not want to see an end to the
embargo and do not want to see normalization with the United States because they would then lose all their excuses for
what hasn't happened in Cuba in the last 50 years,"" Clinton said.
""I find that very sad, because there should be an opportunity for a transition"" to democracy in Cuba,"" said Clinton, who
was answering a student's question during a visit to the University of Louisville in the state of Kentucky.
""The people of Cuba should have democratically elected leaders and a chance to chart their own future. But
unfortunately, I don't see that happening while the Castros are still in charge,"" the top US diplomat said.
Raul Castro officially became president in 2008 after his older brother was sidelined with serious health problems.
However Fidel, now 83, remains enormously influential in Cuban affairs.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Statement by the Secretary
The Death of Polish President Kaczynski and His Delegation
I join President Obama in offering my deepest condolences to the people of Poland, to the Kaczynski family, and to the
families of all those killed in this tragedy. Lost alongside President Kaczynski and his wife were Polish leaders from
across the political spectrum, men and women who shaped and sped Poland's post-1989 democratic transformation and
were leading Poland into its promising future. The tragedy of these lives cut short will be felt deeply across the world,
but their legacy will live on in a free and flourishing Poland.
The United States stands with the Polish people in this difficult hour. Like the country he led, President Kaczynski was
one of America's most valued and trusted allies. He was well known in the United States as a champion for democracy
against an oppressive regime, a man whose journey took him from the Gdarisk Shipyards to the presidency of a free
people. President Kaczynski was an unstinting advocate for freedom and human rights not just in Poland, but around
the world. He will be long remembered and sorely missed.
The Polish people have endured more than their share of sorrow, but they have always shown resilience and resolve in
the face of adversity -- and I know they will pull together in solidarity to grieve this loss.
My thoughts and prayers are with all the people of Poland today.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Jake asked me to send you a brief update on the effort to create an internal USG website for housing interagency
information about the attitudes, concerns, and media habits of foreign audiences (following up on the memo INR sent to
you on this subject in February).
INR is working with the interagency to create six initial country pages (Indonesia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and
Yemen) on this website. In addition to background information about each country and its relationship with the United
States, each page will focus on providing up to date information on how local audiences view the United States and an
analysis of the mediums through which local audiences get their news. Pages will also include a list effective messaging
themes that would resonate with target audiences in each country.
In the coming weeks, INR will be receiving interagency feedback on these initial draft web pages, and will be seeking
guidance as to which additional countries should be covered. The hope is that each page will evolve over time based on
user feedback.
Please let me know if you would like any further information.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
IRAQI NATIONAL ELECTIONS
I congratulate all the people of Iraq who participated in national elections today and over the past three days. There is
no better rebuke to the violent extremists who seek to derail Iraq's progress. Our thoughts and prayers are with the
families who lost friends and loved ones, and we salute the determination of the Iraqi people to reaffirm their
commitment to democracy and to charting their own future free of fear and intimidation.
Thanks to the efforts of the Iraq High Electoral Commission and the Iraqi Security Forces, which organized the voting and
ensured security at thousands of polling sites throughout the country, Iraqi men and women from all parts of the
country were able to go to the polls and choose their leaders freely.
I also would like to commend Ambassador Hill, General Odierno and all the U.S. civilian and military personnel who
supported this historic effort.
Iraqis have chosen a new government to lead their country at a critical time. In the coming months, we will work
together with Iraqi leaders as our partnership continues its transition to a primarily civilian focus, with the goal of
building a long-term, multidimensional relationship between our two nations - a relationship that will contribute to
stability in the Middle East and growing peace and prosperity in Iraq.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

down after three minutes
Latest row comes on eve of critical vote in Stormont assembly on transfer of justice powers from London to Belfast
• Henry McDonald, Ireland correspondent
• quardian.co.uk, Monday 8 March 2010 17.36 GMT
• Article history
A meeting between the Ulster Unionists and Northern Ireland's deputy first minister aimed at securing the party's support
for the devolution of policing and justice broke down in acrimony this evening.
The encounter between Martin McGuinness and a UUP delegation lasted all of three minutes at Stormont.
The latest row comes on the eve of a critical vote in the Stormont assembly on transferring justice and policing powers
from London to Belfast. The UUP has indicated it will not support the last act of devolution because they believe the entire
power-sharing executive is dysfunctional.
Sir Reg Empey, the UUP leader, told the Guardian last month his party would not support the transfer of these powers
unless it obtained concessions on education — specifically the retention of academic selection to grammar schools at 11.
Following the aborted meeting today, the UUP released a statement condemning both McGuinness and Peter Robinson,
the first minister, who is leader of the rival Democratic Unionist party. The UUP claimed it had been ejected from the
deputy first minister's office.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Ulster police deal
Yes vote on Hillsborough agreement would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next
month
David Cameron has been given a stark warning from Washington that dissident terrorists will be ""emboldened""
to intensify their attacks in Northern Ireland and millions of dollars of US investment will be threatened if he
fails to persuade the Tories' Ulster Unionist partners to endorse the final stage of the peace process.
In a sign of deep unease in Washington at the Tories' electoral pact with the UUP, a bipartisan group of US
Congress members have demanded Cameron must ""aggressively"" encourage his partners to endorse the deal in
a vote in the Northern Ireland assembly on Tuesday.
""At this defining moment in the peace process, it is crucial that all the political parties speak with one voice
about their shared future,"" the members of Congress wrote in a private letter to Cameron.
Without a unanimous vote, they said, the province's elected officials would be sending the wrong message to
the people they represent, and to the world.
""Dissidents are trying to destabilise the political institutions and turn the clock back ... These dissidents will
continue to be emboldened if they sense there is no political unanimity on the way forward ... The challenge of
bringing good jobs to Northern Ireland will be made more difficult if potential investors do not believe there is
political stability.""
The letter by congressional leaders of the 41 million-strong Irish-American community has been passed to the
Guardian before the crucial vote on last month's Hillsborough agreement between Sinn Fein and the Democratic
Unionists.
A yes vote would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month in what the British
government has dubbed the final piece in the jigsaw of the 1998 Good Friday agreement.
The congressmen and women, whose views reflect the private misgivings of the US secretary of state, Hillary
Clinton, wrote to Cameron after learning that his electoral partners in Northern Ireland were voicing doubts
about endorsing the deal. Clinton is said to be alarmed that Cameron has either failed, or not bothered, to warn
the UUP of the dangers of obstructing the deal.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

202-647-7209Jeff,
Wanted to fill you in on a call I just received from key Qadhafi staffer Mabrouka al Sharef; she's the one who
initially flagged for us last week that there was GOL blowback to A/S Crowley's comments.
Sharef began by stating how much Libya valued the bilateral relationship with the US, how we had all worked for
years to improve things between our countries, ""only to have it all ruined in one minute by your spokesman.""
Sharef said she had sat in on meetings today with Qadhafi, PM Baghdadi, and Qadhafi chief of staff Bashir Saleh.
She said all were ""angry and upset"" that there had still been no apology from the USG for the ""insult to the
Leader."" I reviewed with her Crowley's March 5 comments, noting that he had clarified his remarks were off-hand
(I translated that in Arabic as ""non-official."") I also briefed her on your and A/S Crowley's meeting with Aujali,
which she had clearly not yet heard about (which means Q most likely had also not been briefed on it). Sharef
said such a meeting was appreciated, but did not meet the Libyan demand for an apology. She said, repeatedly
throughout the conversation, ""The Brother Leader is upset that no one from the USG has explained that this
spokesman was not speaking for them, and made clear that his comments were wrong, and apologized for them.
He expected behavior and words like this from Switzerland, not from the US."" She noted that Q had remarked
that he had said nice things about President Obama during his meetings with people from the US Embassy (""You
reported that back to Washington, right""; I assured her we had), and was thus surprised that the USG responded
with ""the words of gangsters!"" Sharef repeatedly referenced NOC Chair Ghanem's meeting last Thursday with",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Dr. Dorothy Height, an icon of America's long march toward equality and a
personal inspiration to us both. As the only woman among the ""Big Six"" civil rights leaders, Dr. Height helped galvanize a
movement that changed our country forever. She organized the ""Wednesdays in Mississippi"" meetings that brought
black and white women together to find common ground and break down barriers. She never stopped fighting for what
she knew was right. And through it all, she was always the best dressed woman in the room. We were blessed to know
Dr. Height, to benefit from her grace, passion and wisdom, and to call her our friend. For decades, starting with the early
days at the Children's Defense Fund, we worked with her, learned from her, and drew inspiration from her example.
From the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to the Congressional Gold Medal, to the unveiling of a long-sought-after bust
of Sojourner Truth in the United States Capitol, we had the privilege of helping honor Dr. Height and her
accomplishments. Born before women had the right to vote, denied access to the college of her choice because of the
color of her skin, and witness to nation divided, Dr. Height dedicated her life to the proposition that all Americans should
have the opportunity to live up to their full God-given potential. Our nation is poorer for her loss but infinitely richer for
the life she led, the progress she achieved, and the people she touched. Our thoughts and prayers are with Dr. Height's
family today, and with her many loving friends and colleagues. She would be the first to tell us that the best way to
honor her memory is to carry forward the work she started and the causes she championed, to open wide the freedom
gates. May we all find the strength and the wisdom to live up to her legacy.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

************
UNAMA MANDATE RENEWAL & RUSSIAN DISCUSSION
On March 22 the Security Council renewed the UNAMA mandate by unanimous consent, but not without a short delay
at the request of Russian PermRep Churkin, who called for last-minute consultations prior to the adoption of the
mandate. Churkin took the floor in closed consultations to ""begin an interactive dialogue"" highlighting the drug problem
caused by Afghanistan's unabated poppy cultivation, noting it fuels domestic corruption and finances the Taliban.
Churkin's ""dialogue"" was triggered by a front-page Sunday New York Times article titled, ""U.S. Turns a Blind Eye to
Opium in Afghan Town.""
Following the adoption of the UMAMA mandate, the Russian Perm Rep took the floor in the chamber and noted Russian
support for the new UNAMA mandate which has ""satisfactory language in all regards.' Churkin emphasized that the
Afghan-led policy of national reconciliation can not contradict past Council resolutions, including the sanctions regime,
and reminded that all who join the reconciliation program must lay down arms, pledge to uphold the Afghan
constitution and break ties with terrorist organizations. Churkin reminded Members that drugs represent a ""direct
threat to international peace and security"" and noted that ""recent media reports"" state that ISM has ""given up"" on
eradication. He called for ISAF to be ""active and robust"" in combating drugs.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Ambassador for life
Career Foreign Service ambassadors almost never serve much longer than their traditional three-year terms
overseas. There have been a few exceptions, most famously former ambassador to Israel Sam Lewis, who was in
Tel Aviv for eight years until 1985. But the rule generally applies.
This summer, however, Ambassador to Kenya Michael E. Ranneberger, a veteran Africa hand, apparently will
begin his fifth year on the job in Nairobi, and there's no nominee in sight to replace him.
That sparked speculation that the administration might want to extend Ranneberger in order to hold the job open
for Sudan special envoy J. Scott Gration, should Gration work out the Sudan mess. Gration, Loop Fans recall,
grew up in Africa and became tight with President Obama when he escorted the then-senator as he toured his
ancestral homeland -- or birthplace, as some folks say.
Gration, a retired Air Force general, early on had been looked at for a top administration job and perhaps as a
replacement for Ranneberger. But we're told that's not happening anytime soon because the White House is not
about to pull him off the full-time Sudan portfolio, despite some criticism that he's too soft on the war criminals.

U.S. Revises Tack on Mideast Arms
Washington, Egypt Discuss Plan to Rid Region of Nuclear Weapons, in Effort to Steal Iran's Thunder at U.N. Conference
By JONATHAN WEISMAN, JAY SOLOMON and JOE LAURIA
The U.S. is negotiating with Egypt a proposal to make the Middle East a region free of nuclear weapons, as the U.S. seeks
to prevent Iran from derailing a monthlong U.N. conference on nuclear nonproliferation that begins Monday.
U.S. officials familiar with the move call it an important step in assuring countries that Washington—criticized by some
for its silence about Israel's undeclared nuclear arsenal—will equitably address weapons proliferation across the region, as
Iran seeks to shift focus away from its own nuclear program.
Washington also reassured Israel it won't foist a nuclear-free zone on the region until all parties agree to it and significant
progress has been made on Mideast peace.
The U.N. conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is held every five years, is expected to begin with a
bang Monday with an address by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has condemned the West for its refusal
to disarm and for tacitly accepting Israel's nuclear capability.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will follow the Iranian leader in the afternoon.
The U.N. talks come at a time when Iran is believed to be heading toward a nuclear capability and the U.S. and allies have
been pressing for new, tough Security Council sanctions to curb Tehran's program.
""The Iranians are clearly intending to spoil the party,"" said a senior U.S. official involved in the nuclear diplomacy. The
official highlighted the importance of raising Mideast nuclear-free zone issues.
The designation of the region as a zone free of weapons of mass destruction was a nonbinding agreement that emerged
from a 1995 U.N. review of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, a 1970 pact to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. That 1995
agreement was pivotal because it won the indefinite extension of the treaty, but no action on the zone has been taken
since.
Senior Obama administration officials said Friday the White House is willing to significantly advance a Mideast nuclear
weapons-free zone, and would support a conference on the subject at a future date. U.S. officials said talks with Egypt
would resume in New York in the coming month. Such a zone is envisaged to include Israel, the Arab states, Iran and
Turkey.
""We've made a proposal to them [Egypt] that goes beyond what the U.S. has been willing to do before,"" said the senior
U.S. official involved in the nuclear diplomacy.
U.S. officials stressed, however, that they didn't believe that would happen without first achieving major advances in
Arab-Israeli peace talks.
""We are concerned that the conditions are not right unless all members of the region participate, which would be unlikely
unless there is a comprehensive peace plan which is accepted,"" said Ellen Tauscher, undersecretary of state for arms",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

4721,2010-04-26T04:00:00+00:00,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - An Iraqi review panel invalidated the votes of 52 candidates of the March election, officials said,
possibly wiping out the slim lead of a Sunni-backed alliance. It was not immediately clear how many of the candidates
barred for alleged ties to Saddam Hussein's banned Baath party had won seats in the March 7 ballot. If the result
changed, the decision could spark anger among Sunnis just as the sectarian violence unleashed after the 2003 U.S.-led
invasion recedes. The panel's ruling was confirmed by Ali al-Lami, a senior member of a commission that sought to bar
candidates with Baath party links, Tariq Harp, a lawyer for Prime Minister Nuni al-Maliki's State of Law coalition, and
Mustafa al-Hiti, a senior member of the winning lraqiya alliance that was heavily backed by Sunnis.

believe that I can - and would very much like to - be able to contribute meaningfully to your work and the mission of the
Department. Issues having to do with the status of children world-wide, health liaison to US AID and a variety of issues
within the realm of disaster response and preparedness.
- I just today participated in and spoke at a major conference in DC on nuclear terrorism. Most of the speakers and
participants were federal officials, including WH staff. One of the key points I made was the extraordinary disconnect
between administration concerns with respect to the possibility of IND/nuclear terrorism and the degree to which this is
essentially ignored in state and local disaster planning, including in the principal target cities. My discussions with
officials in Great Britain and a couple of other countries reveal a similar inability to deal with nuclear preparedness. For
many of these folks, here and abroad, images of apocalyptic destruction - as was the actual threat during the nuclear
arms race with the Soviets - are just paralyzing.
However, a terrorist IND, is not an all-out nuclear war. Current, scientific modeling suggests that minimal planning for
an IND could save hundreds of thousands of lives and create a much high level of resiliency than we currently have
I believe that an international consortium of disaster response and recovery planning officials should be considered as a
means of increasing attention and resources focused on nuclear - and CBRNE in general - terrorism readiness. We have
much that could be learned from one another in terms of advancing this work. My center at Columbia recently held a
very successful and productive conference called ""Day 3""
, focused on the regional conditions and projections 72 hours post IND detonation.
- Natural disasters also remain a major challenge and potentially increasingly so over the years to come. I feel that
there is much to be gained by upgrading the level and quality of our international collaboration around disaster
response planning - and particularly major disaster recovery, still one of the great unsolved challenges world-wide.",lauren.jiloty@univ-tlse3.fr

cdmDear Cheryl,
Good morning on a consequential and indeed historic week in the life of our country given the passage of health care
reform. President Obama was courageous, persevering and skilled in his leadership and efforts. Having said that, in my
humble opinion, he would not have been successful had it not been for President Clinton's, Hillary's and our efforts in
1994. That's my story and I'm sticking to it, and I believe it's true.
I know this has been a particularly demanding week in the life of the Secretary and in your life as well. Having
Netanyahu, AIPAC and a major trip to Mexico to fight the narco-traffickers is a formidable task even for Hillary Clinton.
Cheryl, I would like to respectfully request a brief meeting or phone call with Secretary Clinton following up on the
conversation she initiated with me at the Vital Voices event regarding the IDB. It's my sense and belief that this matter
needs to be carefully handled for a number of reasons including the longstanding friendship that both the Secretary and
President Clinton have with Luis Alberto Moreno. I also have another important and timely matter (personal not
business) that I would like to discuss with Hillary in our time together.
As I think you know, I try to be very judicious about these types of requests. I think 15 minutes either in person or by
phone will be adequate to cover both of these subjects. As always, I appreciate your consideration relating to my
request. Thank you and I'll await your guidance and direction.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr lona.valmoro@univ-tlse3.fr

Thanks for your trademark prompt, clear and courteous response. As always, it and you are appreciated knowing the
demands of your responsibilities.
I fully realize that the Secretary is engaged (understatement of the year), so I will wait on and anticipate her call as soon
as she has a convenient window to do so. The matters I would like to discuss with Hillary are very timely and important
but not urgent.
I will be available on my cell phone or through my assistant
will be traveling with me. Coordinates in London are as follows.Dear Mack:
Thank you for following up on this matter. I know she appreciated your conversation and has been concerned about this
matter.
I will flag for Lona — this week is relatively hectic so it may be a weekend or next week call but will flag now as this issue
is ripe.Dear Cheryl,
Good morning on a consequential and indeed historic week in the life of our country given the passage of health care
reform. President Obama was courageous, persevering and skilled in his leadership and efforts. Having said that, in my
humble opinion, he would not have been successful had it not been for President Clinton's, Hillary's and our efforts in
1994. That's my story and I'm sticking to it, and I believe it's true.
I know this has been a particularly demanding week in the life of the Secretary and in your life as well. Having
Netanyahu, AIPAC and a major trip to Mexico to fight the narco-traffickers is a formidable task even for Hillary Clinton.
Cheryl, I would like to respectfully request a brief meeting or phone call with Secretary Clinton following up on the
conversation she initiated with me at the Vital Voices event regarding the IDB. It's my sense and belief that this matter
needs to be carefully handled for a number of reasons including the longstanding friendship that both the Secretary and
President Clinton have with Luis Alberto Moreno. I also have another important and timely matter (personal not
business) that I would like to discuss with Hillary in our time together.
As I think you know, I try to be very judicious about these types of requests. I think 15 minutes either in person or by
phone will be adequate to cover both of these subjects. As always, I appreciate your consideration relating to my
request. Thank you and I'll await your guidance and direction.
Personally,
Mack",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Ciudad Juarez Principal Officer Ray McGrath called Ops at 2050 to report two killings involving LES employees.
Earlier on March 13, drug cartel hit teams fired upon two separate privately owned vehicles at two separate
locations. The incidents happened between 1400 and 1700 local. In one vehicle, the husband of a LES was killed. In
the second, the LES and her husband were killed. Both LES were at the same social event before the hit. The PO is
working to find out if anyone else is at risk.
PO McGrath said colleagues in El Paso state there are some indications that the attack was a case of mistaken
identity. A vehicle of similar make & model is being targeted by the cartels.
RSO Greg Houston is currently in Monterrey, but is working with his A/RSO to send a spot report. RSO Houston's is

The Wynn Macau well known brand in China and Steve Wynn is an extremely popular figure in China. In

the numbers of people crossing, as the data reflect only those being processed correctly. Some Haitians are
sneaking across the border, per USG official. Haitian media also report ""tens of thousands"" leaving Port-au-

travelers without documents. Dominican authorities at the other side of the border crossing are generally
turning away travelers without a valid visa or official travel document. Medical emergency cases continue

Iceland legalizes same-sex marriage
The Icelandic parliament, Albingi, legalized same-sex marriage June 11. The vote was 49-0. Fourteen MPs
skipped the vote.
Same-sex couples will be able to marry starting June 27.
The registered-partnership apparatus that gay couples used in the past will no longer be available.
The national LGBT association, Samtokin 78, said Iceland had removed the last obstacle to equal rights for all.
Iceland is the ninth nation where same-sex couples can marry nationwide and the 11th nation where same-sex
marriage is possible.
Icelandic Prime Minister Johanna Siguroardottir is openly lesbian.
Gay marriage also is legal in Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain,
Sweden, Mexico City, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont and Washington, D.C.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

It focused on citing the illegitimacy of US nuclear and nonproliferation policy, and on highlighting that it is the nuclear
weapons states which are to blame for both proliferation and global instability. The speech suggested that US
nonproliferation efforts are a cynical attempt to divert attention from our aim to keep nuclear weapons for ourselves
and that even things like the Nuclear Summit are nothing more than such a veil. The speech made several pointed
attacks on the USG, from the USAF's security issue a few years ago to our use of nuclear weapons in WWII (making us
""the most hated"" in history) to allegations of support for terrorism (including that only states who have and have used
nuclear weapons could support nuclear terrorism). The speech offered 11 ""proposals"", most of which were previewed
in Tehran press today. These include legally binding NSAs, suspension of IAEA membership for those who threaten with
nuclear weapons, disarming all US nuclear bases, support for a ME w/o nuclear weapons and restructure of the UNSC.

That's what a pair of young State Department officials found in Syria, where they were leading a trade delegation of
Silicon Valley executives. Their bosses back in Washington were mortified when media blogs picked up the musings of
Alec Ross and Jared Cohen on Twitter about which Syrian cafes serve the greatest frappuccino (Kalamoon
University) and their challenge to the Syrian telecom minister for a cake-eating contest (called ""Creative Diplomacy."")
Creative, indeed.
It was a mild, but unfortunate distraction from what was widely considered an otherwise productive mission. The
delegation of senior executives, from tech heavyweights like Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Dell, met with Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad and other officials, as well as businessmen, civil society groups and academics battling their
government's tight-fisted control on the Internet.
The visit illustrated both the opportunities and the landmines Hillary Clinton's State Department has to navigate as it
logs into the digital age.
In Foggy Bottom, one needs to be fired up about being wired up.
Blogging and tweeting are now part of every diplomat's job description. At any given moment you can find someone like
the top official on Latin America tweeting in Spanish about his latest trip to Peru, or Secretary Clinton herself posting
podcasts on the State Department website and soliciting questions from the public on the State Department's blog,
Dipnote.
Beneath the web atmospherics is what Ross, Clinton's ""innovation""
guru, calls ""21st century statecraft.""
Ross, a 38-year-old former technology adviser to the Obama campaign, and his partner in crime, Jared Cohen, a 28-year-
old author on genocide, youth and jihad who joined the State Department during the Bush administration, are at the
forefront of a new push by Clinton to use technology and social media as a diplomatic tool. Since taking office, Clinton
has made the spread of information technology and Internet freedom a cornerstone of her foreign policy, hoping both
will serve as catalysts for spreading democracy.
It used to be one of the biggest carrots the State Department could dangle before a country was a visit by the secretary
of state. Now it is a delegation of Silicon Valley heavyweights led by Ross and Cohen, which might include executives
from Microsoft, Google or Facebook.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

You will have seen press reports that Micheletti is stepping down — reportedly it will be a ""leave of absence"" for legal
reasons. If this holds, it is an important development that we have been pushing to allow space for Pepe Lobo to get off
to a good start and encourage greater attendance at the Jan 27 inauguration. This was the point of my Jan 5-6 trip to
Tegucigalpa, Hugo's consistent efforts and our follow-up visa revocations. Two nights ago President Martinelli of
Panama called me saying Micheletti wanted to find a way out and would he, Martinelli, talk to me. I spoke with
Martinelli about ten times over the last two days to discuss specifics. Micheletti wanted to depart Friday but I told
Martinelli that it had to be today because regional leaders need time to make their plans. Micheletti wanted assurances
that visas would be restored, but we simply forward to Martinelli our standing press guidance that we continuously
review visa decisions based on the situation on the ground. ck

to be on the ground dealing with the operation and also translating for the public what is going on. I know you don't
enjoy doing press, but you are very good at it and I think it is important for the American public to understand the

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
Bombing of the Shrine of Syed Ali Hujviri in Lahore
I was shocked and saddened by yesterday's attack on one of Pakistan's most popular places of worship, the Shrine of
Syed All Hujviri (Data Ganjbakhsh) in Lahore, which claimed the lives of many innocent Pakistanis.
The extremists have shown that they respect neither human dignity nor the fundamental religious values of Pakistani
society. Violating the sanctity of this revered shrine is a particularly sinister attempt to destabilize Pakistan and to
intimidate its people. The attackers will not succeed, as the Pakistani public refuses to be cowed by such violence.
We condemn this brutal crime and reaffirm our commitment to support the Pakistani people in their efforts to defend
their democracy from the violent extremists who seek to destroy it. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of
the victims and with all the people of Pakistan.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Lessons from the Aceh and Nias Multi-Donor Trust Fund
1. The Government of Indonesia (G01) responded to the Tsunami by issuing a series of government decrees,
and immediately organized both overview and relief efforts to ensure a rational and coordinated
response. The first task was to produce a Damage and Loss Assessment (DLA). The DLA was followed by
a more detailed Master Plan for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (MPRR). The MPRR provided in-depth
sector plans, spatial planning, the governance and supervision arrangements of finances with
considerable attention to how to avoid or minimize corruption. The process behind the MPRR was
consultative, with a wide range of local stakeholders and public offices being heard. The MPRR was
presented on 26 March, only 3 months after the Tsunami.
2. The MPRR was to form the basis for a general three-stage strategy. The Relief phase was originally set toNo official deadline. I just ran off an FAQ and gave it to her. But would be interested to know if you have insights into
what worked and what didntBest wishes, _ILNew tasking directly from the Secretary to me (and you now!). She wants information about how the Aceh fund worked
and how we can replicate it and what did or didn't work. I was going to start doing some research now but would
welcome your help on that too.Thanks for the feedback. I really hope Monday will break sufficient ground to move forward swiftly. There will only be
broad global public support for a limited time, in which decisions have to be set in stone. I looked back at all these Haiti
donor conferences after the countless disasters. More of the same will only mean more big catastrophes.Excellent points. Thanks so much.Importance: High

-Have not had a chance to read yet but wanted to share asap. Paul and Jean-Louis are still working on scrubbing our
strategy for adds and drops.
-Meghann,
A couple of ideas.
1.To avoid a coordination nightmare, try to get a structure in which there is a single authority with some temporary
power - e.g. a senior Haiti figure (ex-PM would be ideal) + Bill Clinton, as co-CEOs, supported by a council where you can
put the key parties on so they dont feel excluded (e.g. EU which will otherwise sulk). It could start from the April Plan and
the US Plan.
2. To scale up basic service provision without doing a total bypass of the state, I suggest the Public Service Agencies
model that I have been working up for the OECD. Essentially, centralized funding of decentralized provision. Fortuitously,
this has just been endorsed by the Davos Global Agenda Council for Fragile States and will be pitched as one of the key
ideas at Davos. I attach the brief Davos write-up of the idea, and a fuller paper that I did recently for the OECD. Please
circulate as you think fit.
If you need anything from me I will be happy to help. I will be in Davos late next week.

of a donor's coordination mechanism that I saw in your policy review powerpoint, with coordination on 'our'

Maybe within the authority, there can be a private sector sub-group coordinated and monitored by the larger

Haiti's private sector will be less interested in decentralized investment, I think, especially if it focuses on

initiative, in conjunction with international public sector organizations.

I am now at my desk. I agree with concerns below. The cementing of the monopoly by Preval for the public container
port is a prime example how elite capture runs directly counter to job creation and social welfare.
Assets (land, heavy equipment, cement, petroleum) that are in high demand during a construction boom are in the
hands of a few. The risk is that price spikes will severely drive out the potential gains from aid dollars. Dual signatures
and injecting foreign experts into a HRA task force to review projects for eligibility will counteract obvious forms of
corruption.
The much harder task is to determine realistic benchmarks for project costs, given transfer pricing and de facto
cartels. Injecting competition and open bidding is needed to counteract this. The problem is that any Haitian firm will
loose business to US or Chinese contractors with much more favorable pricing structures (but limited spillovers to local
economy). A middle ground may be to invite joint ventures between Haitian and international companies to build up the
local workforce and overall skill base.

Thanks much appreciated.
I believe we went in with a reasonably comprehensive service we wanted to
provide acute trauma care in an orthopedic disaster. Our plan was to be at a
hospital where we could utilize our abilities as trauma surgeons treat the acute
injuries involved in an orthopaedic disaster. We expected many amputations
however came with a philosophy that would reasonably start limb salvage in what
we thought was a salvageable limb.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

I just arrived back but my heart and mind are back in Haiti I am thankful that you helped me get there and supported
the resurrection of the hospital in just one week. General Keen was key in reestablishing the hospital (and I got to
appreciate MRE's). When we got there there were 1500 patients and 400 corpses in a deserted hospital — our team of 7
was the only group there.... And slowly over the week we have built a functioning hospital again.
Meeting and working with Paul has been good for the soul---- although when I felt I wanted to meet him –this was not
the way...But I think I am in this for the long haul...
Below is an email for President Clinton (it was good to see him and Chelsea and Mark there) I promised to forward this
email by a medical student he spoke to in the operating room .... Desperate to find a way to continue his education.
Attached is picture of him and I in front of the surgery area. And there were 3 more I met a few nights later who had
volunteered since the first days but had not eaten in a week (I managed to gather bag of biscuits from the world food
program from behind 3 padlocks after 1 hours of searching–They slept on the hospital grounds because their homes
were destroyed.
I am not sure what we can do... But I promised to pass this on!
Thank you for who you are in the world.. God bless you!
Your friend in gratitude,

My name is the young man who took to you on the Hospital in Haiti.
With all my Heart i want to thank you so much for helping Haiti in this terrible situation,... Thank you so much for your
visit in the country, we really appreciate that, so thank you so much...
As you know, all the universities are broken, so now we get no way to continue our education... And we are with our
family in the streets, so life is become more difficult as we never imagine.... I know that the USA used to help Haiti with
Scholarship, but is really sad to tell you that the kind of young man as me, never get chance to benefice a scholarship,
just because we are in the last categories in the society (the poor persons)....So, In that Situation we need your help
more than ever, Please, please, please M. President we are ""3"" friends are helping in the hospital since after the
catastrophe, and now we are thinking about how to continue to sturdy, So Please, please, please help us have a
scholarship in USA... And we promiss to come back after to teach, and help the orders... God will Bless you for that M.

FYI.FYI for you and HRC
Ambassador Eikenberry and Chairwoman Lowey had a positive conversation that lasted more than an hour. He thanked
the Chairwoman for her leadership and support and for her willingness and commitment to work with her colleagues to
secure the significant amounts of funding that is so essential to the success of our Mission's programs and efforts. They
had a very candid and detailed conversation about the elements, causes, and contributors to corruption in Afghanistan
and the various interagency programs that are partnering with Afghan institutions to promote transparency and
investigate corrupt practices and prosecute corrupt actors.
Chairwoman Lowey appreciated Ambassador Eikenberry's detailed analysis and thorough review of the conditions in
Afghanistan. She stated that there is an absolute need to ensure meaningful and effective accountability of US taxpayer
funds appropriated by Congress. She conceded that we are not going to create an utopian society free of corruption,
but stressed the need for accountability and transparency. She was particularly concerned with various reports that
officials within the GIRoA are impeding the Embassy's efforts to assist the Afghans in investigating and prosecuting
corrupt actors. The Chair asked if there are enough credible partners in the Afghan government who are committed to
good governance and transparency. Ambassador Eikenberry provided an assessment of where he thought the
challenges are, the next steps to be taken, and how progress can be made going forward.
The Chair reiterated her longstanding support for assistance programs, especially education and health, and she asked
Ambassador Eikenberry if he felt we are making progress in the areas of health, education, and agriculture. He provided
a review of the various health, education, and agriculture programs and the multitude of changes that have been
implemented to ensure greater transparency, accountability, and flexibility of funds and how these changes have better
equipped the embassy to hold contractors accountable.
The Ambassador raised the certification of Ministries program; how we are seeking to certify additional ministries once
the Ministries achieve the appropriate level of financial accountability standards; and how these efforts will help
develop Afghan capacity and ultimately allow us to increase the amount of assistance that goes through the Afghan
government. They discussed the NSP program, and the Chair reiterated her support for the program and how she had
consistently increased funding for NSP.
Ambassador Eikenberry explained the Afghan public's reaction to reports that the assistance money had been removed
and he respectfully encouraged her to reinstate the funding as quickly as possible so as to send a clear message to
Afghans that we intend to have an enduring civilian assistance presence. He invited her to visit Afghanistan for several
days and travel the country to see first-hand the progress that has been made and the challenges and opportunities that
remain. She thanked him for his invitation and suggested that any visit might have to be deferred until November.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

15th Anniversary of Srebrenica Genocide
Today we remember the tragic events in Srebrenica fifteen years ago. I join President Obama and the people of the
United States in offering our deepest condolences on this most solemn occasion. We honor the memories of the victims
and mourn with their families.
The United States stands with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and all countries in the region who wish to foster peace and
reconciliation. We remain committed to ensuring that those responsible for these crimes face justice. We recognize that
there can be no lasting peace without justice. It is only by bringing all responsible parties to account for their crimes that
we will truly honor Srebrenica's victims.
We are duty-bound — to the victims, to their surviving family members, and to future generations — to prevent such
atrocities from happening again. Our common faith in the value of freedom and peace unifies us and drives us to act.
That is why we are committed to working with all the communities that make up Bosnia and Herzegovina to move
forward and build a pluralistic, democratic state that can take its rightful place in the Euro-Atlantic community. A
prosperous, free, and unified Bosnia and Herzegovina is the most worthy monument to those who lost their lives at
Srebrenica and the best guarantee against such a tragedy ever repeating itself.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

The Security Council deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force during the Israeli military
operation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza. The Council, in this context, condemns those acts
which resulted in the loss of at least ten civilians and many wounded, and expresses its condolences to their
families. The Security Council requests the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel. The
Council urges Israel to permit full consular access, to allow the countries concerned to retrieve their deceased and
wounded immediately, and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance from the convoy to its destination. The
Security Council takes note of the statement of the UN Secretary—General on the need to have a full investigation into
the matter and it calls for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international
standards. The Security Council stresses that the situation in Gaza is not sustainable. The Council re-emphasizes the
importance of the full implementation of Resolutions 1850 and 1860. In that context, it reiterates its grave concern at
the humanitarian situation in Gaza and stresses the need for sustained and regular flow of goods and people to Gaza as
well as unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. The Security Council
underscores that the only viable solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement negotiated between the parties
and re-emphasizes that only a two-State solution, with an independent and viable Palestinian State living side by side in
peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours, could bring peace to the region. The Security Council expresses
support for the proximity talks and voices concern that this incident took place while the proximity talks are underway
and urges the parties to act with restraint, avoiding any unilateral and provocative actions, and all international partners
to promote an atmosphere of cooperation between the parties and throughout the region.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

In advance of your meeting tomorrow with George Soros, below is some information in response to the letter you

providing more USG support for AUCA
Since 9/11 the United States has provided more than $15 million to AUCA in support of its endowment and various
other initiatives. For a majority of these contributions the Soros Foundation matched one dollar for every two dollars
provided by the USG. The major USG contributions to AUCA were two grants to the university endowment, the first in
2003 for $10 million, the second in 2008 for $3 million. Other USG support for AUCA included funding for two advisors to
the AUCA president on accreditation and development, support for the journalism faculty, and scholarship funds for
students from Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan to attend the university.
Soros has proposed that the USG increase this support, offering a 1-1 match of $10 million each from State and his
foundation, totaling $20 million over the next five years. Last fall SCA received the same proposal from Soros, and they

So it has happened again. Nearly 18 months after the Israelis bombed Gaza to a wasteland, with barely a load of building
materials allowed in since then, Turkey has taken the brunt of an operation of humanitarian assistance gone wrong.
The UN must establish the facts impartially and independently and, if laws have been broken, those responsible must be
held to account. Political demonstrations posing as relief flotillas go wrong too easily and Israel understandably has to
prevent weapons being smuggled into Gaza. But was this really the best way to bring the ships to shore for examination?
A commando attack on civilian ships looks callous and disproportionate. No one should have been hurt, whatever the
emotions behind all this.
Why is Gaza under siege in the first place? Under international law, the Israelis are responsible as the occupying force for
the proper administration of the territory; and half the point of Israel is not to be above the law. Yet they are creating a
traumatised territory of 1.5m neighbours, many of whose children seem to want to grow up to be suicide bombers. They
are also pouring fertiliser on al-Qaida's ground.

5122,2010-06-03T04:00:00+00:00,"Fyi — cir to team for addressing as appropriateDear Cheryl —
In my last email (Friday, 5/28), I attached the letter from the bipartisan Co-Chairs and
Executive Committee members of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission sent to Assistant
Secretary Mike Posner expressing grave concern about the recent rise in death threats, attacks
and murders of Colombian human rights defenders, religious, community and other NGO
leaders. Congressman McGovern also strongly encouraged the Secretary to meet with
representatives of those organizations and individuals being threatened, with a particularly
effort to reach out to and invite the Bishops of Tumaco (Narifio), Barrancabermeja/Medio
Magdalena (Santander), and we would now add Putumayo, since the Colombian Catholic Church
just advised us yesterday of increased death threats against religious workers there. In addition, we
recommended inviting Monsetior Hector Fabio Henao, director of Pastoral Social, at the
Archdiocese in Bogota, who represents all the pastoral work of the Church throughout the country,
as well as representatives from the Mennonite and Lutheran churches, in particular.
While in Colombia, the most important thing the Secretary can do is avoid effusive praise
for President Alvaro Uribe, who leaves office in August. Inside Colombia, the visit by the
Secretary is being described as focusing solely on the free trade agreement and continuing support
of the counterdrug strategy/Plan Colombia. Without changes in the human rights situation and the
culture of impunity, it is unlikely that anything the Secretary might say or do will alter the equation
on Capitol Hill regarding the trade agreement. It should be noted that the October 2008 GAO
report on the counter-drug operations in Colombia concluded that U.S. assistance was successful in
increasing security in parts of the country, but a failure in the areas of counter-narcotics (GAO-09-
71) and a subsequent April 2009 USAID evaluation on U.S. aid for Plan Colombia for illegal crop
reduction and Colombian countemarcotics policies actually contribute to increased coca
production.

of Western Pennsylvania to the halls of Congress, Jack Murtha lived by the Marine Corps credo ""Semper Fidelis,"" never
wavering in his faithful commitment to the country he loved and the men and women who bravely defend her. In war
and in peace, he fought for what he knew was right, even when it was unpopular. He was a fierce advocate for working
families struggling with a changing economy and for better health care and equipment for servicemembers. And over
the course of more than three decades in Congress, he became one of our nation's most respected voices on national
security and foreign policy. Presidents of both parties sought his advice and generations of colleagues looked to him for
leadership and wisdom. As Senator from New York serving on the Armed Services Committee, I was fortunate to call
Jack a friend and mentor. And as Secretary of State, I continued to rely on his expertise and judgment. I knew that Jack
would always shoot straight, like the Marine he was, and never shy away from a difficult question or a tough fight. Today
our country has lost a decorated war hero and a distinguished public servant. The men and women of the our armed
forces have lost a tireless champion. And the people of Pennsylvania's 12th district have lost a neighbor, an advocate,

Brazilian FM defends dialogue with Iran
BRASILIA, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said Tuesday Brazil would maintain negotiations
with Iran on uranium enrichment and oppose any sanctions against Iran.
Amorim said Brazil was against the production of nuclear weapons, but Iran had the right to carry out a peaceful nuclear
program.
""Dialogue is still possible. What we want is to make sure (that the uranium will not be used to make weapons) through
peaceful ways and dialogue,"" Amorim told reporters.
Under a draft deal brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear watchdog, most of Iran's
existing low-grade enriched uranium should be shipped to Russia and France, where it would be processed into fuel rods
with a purity of 20 percent.
Iran declared on Tuesday it had started the process of producing 20-percent enriched uranium inside the country.
In response to Iran's announcement, the U.S.-led Western countries have warned to take political and economic
sanctions against Iran.
For his part, Amorim said he considered any kind of sanctions ineffective and dangerous because they might cross a limit
and jeopardize peace.

to have its own peaceful nuclear program including uranium enrichment similar to Brazil's, following international

intensify our relationship with the EP over the past several months. Specifically, we have,
(1) Increased the flow of high-level USG visitors to the EP. Recent visitors include Janet Napolitano, Dick
Holbrooke, George Mitchell, Dick Morningstar and Ron Kirk. These visits culminated last month in a
highly successful address by VP Biden to a Plenary Session of the EP. I hope that you will also address
a Plenary Session of the EP in the near term. (Your town hall meeting at the EP with young leaders last
year was well-received here.)
(2) Increased the flow and quality of EP interactions in Washington. We have facilitated a dramatic
increase in the number of EP delegations visiting Washington and a significant improvement in the level
of their access to high-level USG officials.
(3) Increased USEU outreach to the EP at every level. At the Mission, we are restructuring the way in
which we interact with EP leaders by institutionalizing responsibility for key relationships and
enhancing accountability. In the coming months, we expect to receive two additional FTEs at the
Mission to improve our ability to cover the EP. We have also encouraged our Embassies in member
State capitals to meet with European Parliament members.

largest city in flames, the worst violence since the president was toppled in April. The interim government in
Kyrgyzstan, which hosts U.S. and Russian military bases, said it was powerless to stop armed gangs from burning down
the homes and businesses of ethnic Uzbeks in parts of Osh. Gun battles raged throughout the night.
""We need the entry of outside armed forces to calm the situation down,"" interim government leader Roza Otunbayeva
told reporters. ""We have appealed to Russia for help and I have already signed such a letter for President Dmitry
Medvedev.""
Russian PM Putin and Otunbayeva discussed the situation in a telephone call on June 12, the Russian government's press
service said, without giving details.
A Reuters correspondent in Osh said gun battles had taken place through the night in an Uzbek neighbourhood. Gas was
shut off to Osh and some neighborhoods have no electricity. ""Entire streets are on fire,"" Interior Ministry spokesman
Rakhmatillo Akhmedov said. ""The situation is very bad. There is no sign of it stopping. Homes have been set ablaze.""
Otunbayeva said Osh was also facing a humanitarian crisis as food was running out. She said her government had
decided to open the border to Uzbekistan to allow fleeing Uzbeks to escape, although it was not clear who controlled
the frontier. One witness said some women and children had made it across to the Uzbek town of Marhamat, 638 miles
from Osh, and camps had been set up for those without family in Uzbekistan. A spokeswoman for the Kyrgyz Health
Ministry said at least 62 people had been killed and 790 wounded in the violence, which is taking place in the southerly
power base of former president Kurmanbek Bakiyev, deposed in April by a popular revolt.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) El Haitian President Rene Preval said Wednesday he will stay in office up to three months
past the end of his term if his earthquake-ravaged nation does not hold a presidential election as scheduled.
His aide said the extension is needed to avoid chaos in case a ballot cannot be held to choose Preval's successor. The
announcement set off an outcry from opposition lawmakers, who called the move unconstitutional and compared
Preval to brutal dictators of the past.
Preval's five-year term is scheduled to end Feb. 7. But electoral officials are struggling to hold the election as scheduled
this fall as it copes with the loss of its headquarters and records, destroyed polling places and some 1.6 million displaced
or deceased voters.
The electoral council, now operating out of a gym seized in a drug raid, is also embroiled in controversy. Opposition
candidates barred from February legislative elections that were canceled after the quake have accused council members
of favoring Preval's newly formed Unity party. One council member also faces dismissal on charges of embezzlement.
In a decree dated Tuesday, the 67-year-old Preval said that if an election is not held before Nov. 28 he can remain in
office for an extra three months 13 until May 14, 2011. That date falls five years after Preval's delayed 2006 inauguration,
which was pushed back by wrangling over the vote count.
""If President Preval were to leave on Feb. 7, while the new president is not elected, we would find ourselves in an
impossible situation,"" his chief of staff, Fritz Longchamp, said.
He said Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive and Cabinet members who signed the decree ""want to make sure that the
country is not going to slip into chaos.""",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

a bit longer. That said, he's agreed to participate in some Track II regional work that Bruce has underway. All in all, it

WASHINGTON, June 23, 2010 (AFP) - President Barack Obama must overhaul the ""completely
dysfunctional"" civilian side of US-led efforts in Afghanistan or risk losing the high-
stakes conflict, three hawkish US Senators said Wednesday.
Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, joined by Independent Senator Joe
Lieberman, stopped just shy of explicitly urging Obama to replace Ambassador Karl
Eikenberry but had harsh words for US diplomacy in Kabul.
""The civilian side is, in my view, completely dysfunctional. The relationship between the
civilian leadership and (Afghan) President (Hamid) Karzai has to be changed and
repaired,"" said Graham.
""I would urge the president to look at this as a chance to put new people on the ground
without old baggage. And if we don't change quickly, we're going to lose a war we can't
afford to lose,"" warned Graham.
Graham and his colleagues warmly praised Obama's decision to replace General Stanley
McChrystal with General David Petraeus, but cautioned that diplomatic failures could
hamstring his efforts to manage the increasingly unpopular war.
McCain suggested that Obama bring back veteran diplomat Ryan Crocker, who was ambassador
to Baghdad when he and Petraeus enacted the ""surge"" strategy credited in Washington with
bringing Iraq back from the brink of civil war.
""We might suggest that a consideration be given to reuniting the Crocker-Petraeus team,
although I'm sure that Ambassador Crocker will never forgive me for saying that, since
he's enjoying his retirement,"" McCain said with a chuckle.
""There is discontent -- or let me say, there is a lack of coordination and teamwork --
between the military and civilian side, both at the embassy and other areas, in
Afghanistan that needs to be repaired,"" said McCain.
Lieberman took a slightly softer line, but underlined he felt ""there is not the kind of
unity in Afghanistan between our civilian and military leadership"" that is needed to
prosecute Obama's counterinsurgency strategy.
The senators sharply criticized McChrystal over a Rolling Stone magazine profile in which
the general and his aides are quoted as mocking top Obama national security aides, from
Vice President Joe Biden on down.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

opposing the budget. Meanwhile, short term support for Cameron is static and for the

Chairwoman Announces Oversight Hearings on Corruption in Afghanistan
WASHINGTON — In light of two troubling news reports on corruption within the Afghan government, Congresswoman
Nita Lowey (D-NY), Chairwoman of the Appropriations State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee, today announced
she is removing funding for Afghanistan beyond humanitarian aid from her 2011 bill scheduled for markup this week.
""The alleged shipment of billions in donor funds out of Afghanistan and allegations of Afghan government insiders
impeding corruption investigations are outrageous,"" said Lowey. ""I do not intend to appropriate one more dime for
assistance to Afghanistan until I have confidence that U.S. taxpayer money is not being abused to line the pockets of
corrupt Afghan government officials, drug lords, and terrorists. Furthermore, the government of Afghanistan must
demonstrate that corruption is being aggressively investigated and prosecuted.
""Rampant corruption fosters the conditions that threaten the security of our troops and the stability of the Afghan
government and economy.""
The State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee will mark up its Fiscal Year 2011 Appropriations Act on
Wednesday June 30th. The subcommittee will not consider any bilateral assistance for the Afghan government other
than lifesaving humanitarian aid at this time.
Lowey also announced the Subcommittee will hold oversight hearings after the July 4th recess to get to the bottom of
these allegations.
""Too many Americans are suffering in this economy for us to put their hard-earned tax dollars into the hands of
criminals overseas,"" said Lowey. ""We will not commit billions more in taxpayer money for Afghanistan until there are
assurances that such funds will be used for their intended purposes and that the government of Afghanistan is willing
and able to root corruption within its ranks. U.S. taxpayers deserve nothing less.""",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr lew.jacobi@univ-tlse3.fr

awkward position not to be agreeable to Luis' continued leadership at the IDB. We are simply unnecessarily complicating

WASHINGTON — As General David H. Petraeus takes command in Afghanistan, the two top American civilian officials in
the war face an uncertain and tricky future, working with a newly empowered military leader, under the gaze of an
impatient president who has put them on notice that his fractious war council needs to pull together.
Richard C. Holbrooke, the Obama administration's special representative to the region, and Karl W. Eikenberry, the
ambassador to Afghanistan, both hung on to their jobs in the uproar that followed Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's career-
ending quotes in Rolling Stone magazine.
But privately, at least one senior White House official suggested using General McChrystal's exit as an excuse for a
housecleaning, according to senior officials. That was rejected as too disruptive during a military campaign that relies
heavily on civilian support, these people said.
In recent days, other administration officials have begun floating the idea that Ambassador Eikenberry might be
replaced by
Ryan C. Crocker, the highly regarded former ambassador in Iraq who forged a close partnership with General Petraeus
during the successful Iraq troop increase.
Such a prospect is viewed as remote, given Mr. Crocker's prestigious new post at
Texas A&M University. But the fact that his name is being invoked underlines the challenges that confront Ambassador
Eikenberry, as he adapts to a new partner — one who has strong ideas about how soldiers and diplomats should work
together in war.
It also illustrates the remarkably powerful role that General Petraeus will assume in the nine-year-old war, setting him
up as almost a viceroy in Afghanistan and a key broker in negotiations between President
Hamid Karzai and Pakistan over an eventual political settlement.
Prior to General Petraeus's arrival, some critics said the White House had created a problem by recruiting several
forceful, ambitious personalities and giving them jobs with overlapping responsibilities. Administration officials
acknowledge that, as one said, ""There are obviously a number of substantial personalities on the team."" But the White
House believes that the current lineup can mesh, and that a difficult war demands this much talent.
Still, the McChrystal blow-up has reverberated through the State Department. Secretary of State
Hillary Rodham Clinton instructed Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke to take a hard look at the civilian team,
two officials said. She is not wedded to the current lineup if it continues to bog down in internecine battles, they said.
""You can't have a major shift in a civ-mil structure without having the civilian side take a step back and look at
everything,"" said a senior State Department official, using the jargon for a civilian-military campaign.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Today a seven hour meeting took place at Downing Street to attempt to determine Gordon's
strategy. The participants were Gordon, Shaun, Peter, Alastair Campbell, and Ed Balls (who is
close to Gordon).
1. Gordon has made a maximum proposal to Clegg through intermediaries, including a
referendum on proportional representation, program, cabinet slots if Clegg wants them, or
not if he prefers to be perceived as above dealmaking. The offer is open, too, and can be
added to. Gordon is letting Cameron and Clegg have their conversation without going
public. Clegg in private is in something of a state of shock. He actually expected to win
about 125 seats—and finished at 57, losing 14 from what the Lib-Dems held. While
Clegg is out front he cannot make a deal on his own; he requires his party's backing.
Gordon and his people are in touch with people close to Clegg. Many of Clegg's senior
people will not support the deal that Cameron has proposed. Vincent Cable, Clegg's
number two, the shadow chancellor, is unhappy with the Tory deal. Clegg is therefore at
sea. Clegg's party base, moreover, would not approve a deal that did not represent a
""progressive"" position. Much of the Lib-Dem base is idealistic and subject to
disillusionment.
2. Gordon is doing whatever he can to hold on to power. Shaun, for his part, is working on
an economic package for Northern Ireland to win support from the DUP and other parties
for Labour—a package to be proposed in the Queen's Speech. Peter floats in and out of
the meeting and appears on TV. Alastair has emerged as a stalwart, providing Gordon
with talking points and practical ideas hour by hour.
3. The Tories are working overtime to foster the atmosphere that Gordon is repudiated and
should leave. This perception is gaining ground as the Cameron-Clegg talks go on.
Cameron seems to be dragging them out in order to undermine Gordon.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Statement by Ambassador Susan E. Rice, U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, on Secretary
General Ban's Panel Concerning the May 31 Flotilla Incident
The United States welcomes today's announcement by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of the
establishment of a Panel regarding the incident of May 31st- We thank both governments for the constructive
and cooperative spirit they have shown and the Secretary General for his leadership and determination. The
Panel, which has the support of both Israel and Turkey, will receive and review the reports of each
government's national investigation into the incident and make recommendations as to how to avoid such
incidents in the future. This Panel is not a substitute for those national investigations. It complements them,
affording Israel and Turkey the opportunity to present the conclusions of their investigations to the international
community. The focus of the Panel is appropriately on the future and on preventing such incidents from
recurring. The United States also hopes that the Panel can serve as a vehicle to enable Israel and Turkey to
move beyond the recent strains in their relationship and repair their strong historic ties.
The United States expects that the Panel will operate in a transparent and credible manner and that its work will
be the primary method for the international community to review the incident, obviating the need for any
overlapping international inquiries. The United States welcomes the naming of the former Prime Minister of
New Zealand, Geoffrey Palmer, as Chair and the outgoing President of Colombia, Alvaro Uribe, as Vice-Chair.
We look forward to the announcement of the two additional members from Israel and Turkey.Hi Erica,

given a speech yet about maternal and child health. We have a great story to tell with our investment in GHI, and there
will be an opportunity to tell it with the ramp-up to UNGA (with the Summit focusing on MDGs). There is a tremendous

Clegg is still in talks with Cameron. About 1,500 Liberal Democrats spontaneously protested at Lib-Dem headquarters
against a deal with the Tories given their policies, especially on Europe. But Clegg remains in negotiations. He seems
quite intent on working it out with Cameron, it appears. His inner Tory magnetically draws him to his heritage. Clegg has
also misplayed almost every turn, presented with big chances and blowing them through a combination of inexperience
(derived partly from heading a party out of power for nearly 100 years) and inbred arrogance (from no less a privileged
background than Cameron, though seeming less snobbish because he went to Westminster instead of Eton and has a
less pronounced upper-class accent, more neutral, because of his more cosmopolitan roots through his family).",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

As requested, below is a brief bio (compiled by DK, INR, and AF) of Kenyan Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Richard
Momoima Onyonka, who you met in Krakow at the Community of Democracies. Please let me know if you would like
any further information or follow up on this.
Thanks,
Mike
Richard Momoima Onyonka is a Kenyan politician and belongs to the People's Democratic Party. Born in 1962 and
hailing from the Bogeka clan, VM Momoima has lived in Otamba, Nyamataro, Mosocho and Nairobi. In 1982, following
the failed Kenyan coup d'etat attempt to overthrow President Daniel Arap Moi's government, VM Momoima was among
the 900 people that were jailed. However, in 1984, he returned to the University of Nairobi and graduated with a
Bachelors degree in commerce a year later. After graduation, VM Momoima attended North Carolina State University
where he graduated with a Masters degree in management. He returned to Kenya in 1992 during the first multi party
elections to help his father (then incumbent MP for Kitutu Chache and Minister for Planning and National Development)
who was seeking re-election on a KANU (Kenya African National Union) ticket. VM Momoima's first political opportunity
arose when his father passed away in 1996, which prompted an election in which he lost to a new corner during the
party (KANU) nominations. Since the Kenyan parliamentary election in 2007, VM Momoima has represented the Kitutu
Chache Constituency in the National Assembly of Kenya.
A financial economist by profession, VM Momoima currently runs personal businesses in Nairobi and Kisii and has held
positions in the Kisii KANU branch. His priorities include economic empowerment, particularly for youth and women,
education, and poverty reduction.

See email chain below. We need to get this info into the system particularly in EUR and the Gulf region but we need to
do so carefully and as David points out with a great deal of sensitivity for the families.
For example when I was in Jeddah I met with a group of prominent Islamic scholars
several of whom were leading Saudi doctors. We talked about ways they could reach out to their colleagues in Pakistan
and Afghanistan. We should get them this information and see if we can enlist them in this effort. Walter will know how
to reach them. David will advise on best way to coordinate with families.

The Secretary this morning spoke with Turkish Foreign Minister Davutoglu regarding Iran. During the call, the Secretary
stressed that, in our view, Iran's recent diplomacy was an attempt to stop Security Council action without actually taking
steps to address international concerns about its nuclear program. There's nothing new and nothing encouraging in
Iran's recent statements. It has failed to demonstrate good faith and build confidence with the international
community, which was the original intent of the Tehran research reactor proposal. It has yet to formally respond to the
IAEA. She stressed that the burden is with Iran and its lack of seriousness about engagement requires us to intensify
efforts to apply greater pressure on Iran. That was the primary purpose of the conversation. They briefly touched on
other subjects, including Middle East peace and the relationship between Turkey and Azerbaijan.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Hamidi's execution is imminent. With your approval we'll put out.
DRAFT STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
Urging Iran to Respect the Fundamental Freedoms of its Citizens
The United States is deeply concerned that Iran continues to deny its citizens their civil rights, as well as to intimidate
and detain those Iranians who seek to hold their government accountable and who stand up for the rights of their
fellow citizens. We remain troubled by the case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, who garnered international attention
for her verdict of death by stoning. While the Iranian government later stated she would not face execution by stoning,
her fate has been left unclear. We are also troubled by reports that Ebrahim Hamidi, an 18-year old charged with
homosexuality, faces imminent execution despite the fact that he is currently without legal representation. Neither of
their cases have proceeded with the transparency or due process enshrined in Iran's own constitution and their lawyer,
Mohammad Mostafaei, felt that he had no other choice than to flee Iran after he had been questioned by authorities
and his family members had been detained.
We are also concerned about the fate of Iranians who are in danger of imminent execution for exercising their right to
free expression after the June 2009 elections, including Jafar Kazemi, Mohammad Haj Aghaei, and Javad Lan.
The United States urges the Iranian government to halt these executions in accordance with its international obligations
to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners
and imprisoned human rights defenders. The United States will continue to stand with people all around the world who
seek to exercise their universal rights and to speak out in defense of human liberties.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

CONFIDENTIAL
May 13, 2010Re: Hague meeting
On your meeting on Friday, May 14, with new British Foreign Secretary William Hague you might explore a
number of issues below. (I've discussed with Shaun.)
Northern Ireland. Cameron has pledged to reduce public sector spending in NI. But the impact of public
sector spending there is not the same as in other parts of the UK because of 40 years of troubles.
Political stability depends upon economic stability. Removing funding specifically threatens community
policing, creating a vacuum that the Real IRA and other men of violence would rush into. Cutting the
public sector would make it difficult to increase private sector investment. Does the new government
understand the US interest in NI and appreciate the fragility of the situation?
Defense and Foreign Policy Cuts. The new government program is to slash the deficit, cutting deeply into
government programs. This really cannot be done without defense and foreign policy reductions. Seek
claficiation on exactly whether and where these cuts be made. Will they affect Afghanistan policy and
over what schedule? How will cuts in the foreign service affect British influence in other areas?
Trident and Nuclear Deterrent. The coalition agreement between the Conservative and Liberal Democrats
allows the LDs to abstain in parliamentary votes on four issues that will apparently let the Tories have",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

since to encompass thousands of centrifuges churning out material enriched to 3.5 percent. But despite three sets of

NEW YORK — The Clintons threw a big Washington bash on June 30 for Hillary Clinton's longtime aide, Hume Abedin,

circle.
Congressional heavyweights thronged the garden of the Clinton spread on Embassy Row, including House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi. The city's big powerbrokers and various State Department honchos were there for a party marking Abedin's
marriage to Congressman Anthony Weiner of New York. But White House insiders stayed away.

Transcript of Malinowski's meeting with Karzai attached.Dear Melanne and Saba,
I've attached the notes from our meeting with Karzai; they may be helpful in preparing for next week
On the positive side, he committed to including women in any formal negotiations with the Taliban. Hopefully we can nail that down
firmly -- it would be both a good safeguard and a signal to the Taliban of the kind of Afghanistan they will be joining if they do indeed
ever want to join it
Beyond that, he was in ""women's lives first, women's rights second"" mode — speaking passionately about the human cost of the
conflict and the impossibility of Afghanistan enjoying genuine human rights until the fighting ends. He did this to the point of
denying that any real human rights progress had come in his presidency (thus implying that bringing in Taliban would not make
matters worse).
In terms of your messaging, it would be great if, when the Secretary stresses that reconciling insurgents should accept the Afghan
constitution and laws, she specifically mentions the right of girls to go to school and work and take part in the political process. That
would be consistent, I think, with what the administration has said before, but more explicit. Karzai told us that his government
already stresses those specific rights (that's not true --but it suggests that it would be hard for them to disagree if the US and
international community made it part of their mantra).
It would also, of course, be great if she could find a way to express concern about giving reconciling Taliban leaders who have a track
record of brutality, including attacks on girls schools and killings of women who defy their threats, positions in local or national
government. One can support negotiations even with the worst of the worst of the Taliban, and offer them other kinds of
incentives. But we should draw the line at offering positions of authority over the lives of the people they have been terrorizing (as
the Pakistanis did, disastrously, in Swat).
Hope this helps,
Tom

State Department is taking right steps to foster Internet freedom
Wednesday, July 21, 2010; Al8
BILLIONS OF people live in countries where the Internet is not free. Confined behind the elaborate firewalls of
authoritarian regimes such as China and Iran, they find their rights to expression threatened online and off-- by
elaborate systems of monitoring and censorship and by harsh laws that punish bloggers with imprisonment or
even death.
In January, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke powerfully in support of Internet freedom, saying,
""We stand for a single Internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas. And we
recognize that the world's information infrastructure will become what we and others make of it.""
Since then, the State Department has brought the issue of online freedom to the table in its diplomacy around
the world and joined with Internet providers and social media companies to foster public-private partnership in
Internet freedom. Such collaboration is key, since authoritarian regimes so often contract out the daily work of
censorship to private companies.
Congress, too, has showed commitment to openness online, allocating $35 million in funding between the 2009
and 2010 budgets for work that promotes Internet freedom. This money has yet to be spent, but the State
Department finally has sent the names of designated recipients of the 2009 budget's $5 million in Internet
freedom funding to Congress for its approval and soon will begin the process for distributing this year's grants.
As it moves forward on this vital issue, the State Department must carefully determine how best to spend its
limited resources. Yes, there is no silver bullet to guarantee freedom on the Internet. But it is possible to do",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

RIYADH (AFP)— An ""inept"" United States cannot fix Afghanistan's problems and should simply focus on ""chasing the

The ex-ambassador to the United States also challenged Washington to produce results in just-started Middle East
peace talks, and accused US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of undermining efforts to make the region nuclear-free.
AFP — Saudi Arabia's former intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal delivers a speech during a conference ...
In a speech in Riyadh before diplomats, Turki said US-led NATO troops had irrevocably alienated the Afghan people and
had no hope of rebuilding the country.
""What Afghanistan needs now is a shift from nation-building to effectively countering terrorists,"" Turki told the Arab
News conference.
US President Barack Obama ""should not be misdirected into believing that he can fix Afghanistan's ills by military
means.""
""Hunt down the terrorists on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistan border, arrest them or kill them, and get out, and let the
Afghan people deal with their problems.
""As long as GI boots remain on Afghan soil, they remain targets of resistance for the Afghan people and ideological
mercenaries.""
Turki, who has long served a central role in Saudi-Afghan relations, scolded Washington's handling of relations with
Kabul.
""The inept way in which this administration has dealt with President (Hamid) Karzai beggars disbelief and amazement.
""Both sides are now filled with resentment and a sour taste in their mouths,"" he said. ""How can they both get out of that
situation? I don't know.""
The chairman of the King Faisal Center For Research and Islamic Studies, Turki has no official position but is believed to
often reflect high level thinking in the Saudi government.
He is the brother of Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, and analysts speculate he could become foreign minister
when Saud retires.
Turki said Arab states have given Washington four months to show progress in US-guided Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
""The Arab world has given Obama until September to get things done,"" said Turki.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Conflict Minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo
Last year in the Democratic Republic of Congo, I spoke out against the trade in ""conflict minerals"" that has
funded a cycle of conflict there that has left more than 5 million people dead since 1998, displaced countless
more, and spawned an epidemic of sexual and gender-based violence.
President Obama has now signed into law a measure that will require corporations to publicly disclose what
they are doing to ensure that their products don't contain these minerals. The DRC has formally expressed its
support for this law and has thanked both the executive and legislative branches of our government. This is one
of several steps we are taking to stop this illicit and deadly trade.
After my visit to the Congo, I directed the State Department to develop a holistic strategy on this issue as part of
our broader effort to engage effectively with the DRC. We continue to work with the government to crack
down on corruption, both bilaterally and through the Great Lakes Contact Group. At the United Nations
Security Council, we successfully pushed to expand the listing criteria in the DRC Sanctions Committee to
include those supporting illegal armed groups through illicit trade of natural resources. We have provided
support for initiatives on certification and due diligence that have been initiated by the government of the DRC,
local and foreign industry groups, and regional and international institutions. And we have met with a wide
range of industry representatives and discussed the responsibility of end-users to ensure their supply chains are
free of conflict minerals.
All of these steps underscore the commitment of the United States to stand with the people of Congo and to
work toward an end to this conflict.

I can't wait for to hear what you think of the film and, if you have the time, how we can strengthen themes and sections
to make it a more relevant and effective educational and policy influencing tool. We are currently at various stages of
reaching out or building partnerships with a wide variety of organizations from Facing History and Ourselves to JStreet to
the Marine Corps to the United Nations
(informally) to various think tanks, and human rights organizations.
We have big plans for the film and hope to use it as a platform to foster critical cross-cultural conversations.
And a disclaimer- the film is still a work in progress. We are drastically changing the intro, moving some sections around,
and adding a story about the Marines sending senior Marine Officers to Jordan to negotiate and build partnerships with
Al Anbar's exiled tribal leaders.
I am so excited for you to see it.
Have a safe trip, I hope to see you soon, and all the best,

of migratory status. They do this in practice routinely. Frequently, individuals who cannot prove legal status are referred
to INM (federal CBP-equivalent). In practice, GoM authorities at all levels engage in exploitative treatment of migrants,
primarily Central Americans heading to the US. These abuses have been well documented by international human rights
groups, as well as by multiple documentary and news media reports.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr
5669,2010-05-20T04:00:00+00:00,"Original MessageAs we discussed in the trip meeting-- I feel that we might miss an important opportunity if we don't try to fit Ecuador
into the Andean trip (Venezuela and Bolivia are out of the question). We could stop in Ecuador by leaving Peru early
Tuesday morning after the OAS GA. The Secretary could deliver her speech in Ecuador, visit w the President and arrive in
Colombia in the late afternoon. Delivering the speech in Quito would avoid upstaging the OASGA FMs in Lima.
The visit to Ecuador would advance already positive areas of cooperation, as well as underscore our desire to see Correa
succeed in achieving constructive institutional reform, while respecting and preserving democratic governance. Correa's
promise to reform Ecuador's political system and address social inequities resonates with a public disillusioned by
decades of corruption and political instability. His agenda is principally driven by nationalism, not anti-Americanism, and
although some of his economic policies mirror those of Venezuela, he is not following a recipe laid down by Chavez.
Despite its rhetoric, the Correa government has cooperated closely with the USG in many areas, including counter
narcotics, anti-corruption, and alternative development assistance. Although Ecuador can be a challenging partner, our
efforts to engage constructively with him are paying off. We had an excellent conversation during my April visit to
Quito, including an open and candid conversation on sensitive issues like freedom of the press and maintaining a
constructive dialogue with civil society. (The gift I gave him for his birthday, an edition of Living History signed by the
Secretary, had a strong positive impact on him. He said that his mother-- who lived much of her life in California is a
great admirer of the Secretary. ) Reporting after my meetings in Quito was very positive and seemed to indicate that
Correa is ready to move beyond the stale rhetoric surrounding the Colombia Defense Cooperation Agreement. Indeed,
there is a terrific opportunity to work tri-laterally with Peru, Ecuador and Colombia not only on counter drug matters-
- but also on environmental issues like deforestation and climate change given the enormous extension of the amazon
basin in those three countries. All three presidents welcomed the suggestion when I raised as a possibility. Working
with them helps to pull Ecuador away from Venezuela while helping to improve cooperation w Colombia.
In sum, a visit to Ecuador would add a sub-regional theme to the trip, engaging with the Andean countries in Lima,
Quito, and Bogota; and then with CARICOM in Barbados. The Secretary has been to Canada, Mexico, Central America,
and the Southern Cone.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

5671,2010-05-20T04:00:00+00:00,"From my daughter MeganFrom my daughter MeganI heard a wonderful story last night praising Hillary Clinton for her work on behalf of children.
Last night I met Don Graves, he runs the Independent Living Skills Program (ILSP) in Contra Costa
County. The program helps children in the foster care system, and among other things, teaches them
skills needed to live on their own as adults.
Don told a heart-warming story of how then First Lady Hillary Clinton came out to visit with the kids in the
program and hear their concerns. A major concern was that resources for kids coming out of foster care
ended at age 18 and 6 months -- they needed more help. Within two years of the visit, President Clinton
signed the Foster Care Independence Act, providing more money and more resources for ages 18 - 21. I
think it is widely accepted that Hillary championed this legislation, and this was surely echoed by Don. He
was beaming with admiration for her and what she accomplished to help the kids.
He went on to say that one of the participants in the program, Alfred Perez, who was part of the original
discussion with the First Lady, was invited to the White House to see the bill signed. Alfred Perez later
served on the Pew Commission on Foster care and is now teaching at the University of",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

denounced as too radical by Begin, adored his son Yoni, heroically killed at Entebbe. Benyamin has never measured up.
Benzion has constantly criticized him in public for his deviations from the doctrine of Greater Israel. Bibi desperately seeks
his father's approbation and can never equal his dead brother. See Benzion's most recent scathing undermining of his son
Bibi and Bibi's tearful tribute to his brother just last month. The raid on the ship to Gaza resembles the raid on Entebbe,
except that there are no hostages, no guns, it's not in Africa, and it's a fiasco; otherwise, it's Entebbe. (Then, there's Ehud
Barak reliving his youth as a raider killing Palestinians in Lebanon, a feat memorialized in Spielberg's film, Munich.

Ben Caspit, Maariv, May 27 2010 [page 2 with front page lead; Hebrew original here and at bottom of post]
In the course of intimate conversations over the past few weeks with top political officials and civil servants, Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has said, according to his interlocutors, that he managed to defeat the US administration.
Netanyahu is pleased by the fact that the Americans failed, so he said, to twist his arm and that ultimately, in the duel between
him and the Obama administration, he was the one who emerged with the upper hand. We did not make concessions on our red
lines and they failed to make us fold and to drag us to places we didn't want to go, said Netanyahu, according to people who
heard him speak.
Netanyahu is convinced that he is not going to be forced to extend the settlement construction freeze, which is due to expire in
September. According to senior officials in Jerusalem, an agreement has already been reached with the administration that the
Israeli government will not announce an extension of the construction freeze in the territories, and the Americans will ""make
sure"" that the Palestinians do not withdraw from the talks. Israel, however, will not take ""aggressive"" action and construction
will be resumed only in areas that are clearly within the consensus inside the settlement blocs.
The Prime Minister 's Bureau vigorously denied the above report. ""The statements attributed to the prime minister are
incorrect,"" said a spokesman in the Prime Minister's Bureau. ""They were not said by Netanyahu in any forum. The reason is",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

demolitions/dislocations.
Dan and David have engaged Molho.The Jerusalem city council is set to review the Kings Garden/Gan Hamelech/Bustan plan tomorrow. Recall that the plan
received approval by a municipal sub committee in late June. The entire city council must now review and approve the
plan because of an administrative appeal filed against it by a Meretz city council member (this appeal process requires
that the entire city council review the plan at some point.) Lots of other details here that Jerusalem will be including in a
front channel cable. Amanda Pilz, CCed here, drafted.
Bottom line though is that (1) this is on the agenda at the explicit direction of the Mayor and deputy mayor and (2)
there is no statutory or other need for this review tomorrow.
Also note that this is not the final step in the process. After full Jerusalem municipal approval the plan must go to
Ministry of Interior bodies. So there is a whole lot of theater involved in this.
Lastly, recall that the Gan Hamelech plan involves extensive demolitions and the redevelopment of Bustan, a section of
the Silwan which is a stone throw away from the Old City. (When S made her comments on demolition in November

ISLAMABAD, Aug. 19 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called his Pakistani
counterpart Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani over phone Thursday to convey the condolences and
commensurations of his government and the people of India on the loss of precious lives
and damage to the properties and infrastructure caused by floods in Pakistan.
The Indian prime minister said that the member States in the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation should come together to help Pakistan in every way possible at this
critical juncture, according to the Pakistani PM office.
Gilani thanked his Indian counterpart for his kind gesture of calling him to express his
sympathies and solidarity with Pakistan in its hour of trial.
He briefed the Indian prime minister over the huge damage caused by this unprecedented
natural calamity in all the provinces of the country, which, according to UN estimates,
was far bigger than the effects of earthquakes and tsunami which hit Pakistan in 2005 and
Haiti last year respectively.
Gilani also availed the opportunity to reiterate Pakistan's keen desire to have friendly,
cooperative and good neighborly relations with India.
He hoped that in accordance with the agreement reached in Thimphu in Bhutan in April, the
bilateral dialogue between the two countries would progress a meaningful, substantive and
result- oriented way by addressing all the issues of concern to both countries including
Kashmir dispute.

special envoy to the Middle East, George Mitchell, said sources in Washington. A number of
additional top officials are expected to be replaced at the same opportunity.
The reasons for Mitchell's replacement are the failure he and his team have had at renewing
the talks between Israel and the Palestinians, the Administration's desire to bring new blood into
the efforts, and pressures to resume the peace process in the region.

Can the Dude Abide?
By MAUREEN DOWD
WASHINGTON
Barack Obama became president by brilliantly telling his own story. To stay president, he will need to show he
can understand our story.
At first it was exciting that Obama was the sort of brainy, cultivated Democrat who would be at home in a
""West Wing"" episode.
But now he acts like he really thinks he's on ""West Wing,"" gliding through an imaginary, amber-lit set where
his righteous self-regard is bound to be rewarded by the end of the hour.
Hey, dude, you're a politician. Act like one.
As the head of the Democratic Party, the president should have supported the Democratic candidate for
governor in Rhode Island, the one the Democratic Governors Association had already lavished more than $1
million in TV ads on. If Obama was going to refuse to endorse Frank Caprio out of respect for Lincoln Chafee,
the former Republican who endorsed him for president and is now running as an independent, the president
should have at least stayed out of Providence.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

""The Middle East peace process resumed in May, after a hiatus of 19 months, but it stalled
again over the terms of moving from indirect talks, mediated by U.S. envoy George Mitchell,
to direct negotiations.
.israel insists it is ready for direct talks, provided there are no preconditions. The Palestinians
are ready provided there is a clear agenda. Israel says an agenda means preconditions.
Resolving the snag over terms is crucial, diplomats say."" Washpost
The former NY Times reporter Judy Miller likes to address me as ""gloomy gus"" or some such
thing when I encounter her. Well, stand by for some more gloom.
The second Camp David talks failed because Dennis Ross and company placed the
Palestinian delegation in a position in which a ""solution"" was demanded and expected by the
Americans and Israelis on the basis of bargaining during the negotiations themselves.
This seemed reasonable at the time to the US and Israeli negotiators. After all, is this not
what one does? Should not the outcome be the product of the dialectic of argument and
persuasion?
Arabs generally think not. They tend to believe that negotiations are for the purpose of of
arranging the details of outcomes that are understood in advance of the conference itself. For
them, anything else is an attempt to win concessions through trickery.
""The Palestinians are ready provided there is a clear agenda. Israel says an agenda means
preconditions.""
Hello! What kind of nonsense is this? Have we learned nothing?
And then, there is the ""little"" matter of the non-participation of Hamas. Does the Obama
Administration really think that this 600 pound gorilla can be ignored? Is this some sort of
scheme on the part of Natanyahu, and ""the boys"" to discredit Abbas so that an isolated
Hamas can be attacked and destroyed later?
Realism in diplomacy is a desirable thing. George Mitchell used to be smarter than this. His
staff should be advising him not to do this. Failure will be catastrophic.
All the players should be engaged, and they are not. The outcome should be known in
advance and it is not.

practically the only sign, however temporary, that there was a US civilian effort in Sindh. So it got some media attention,

hospital (which I drove by in Thatta) Turkey, Saudi Arabia (I visited their refugee camp, where they are building a
mosque), Australia (field hospital in multan), Switzerland, UK, etc. While we hide and the NGO partners refuse to admit
that we fund them.
In addition, our employees are prevented from spending time in the affected areas, which they can visit only under very
stringent conditions and heavy security imposed by RSOs. For example, the fabled AID DART teamn can hardly get out of

Next Sunday (October 17th) Valerie and I arrive in DC for a week of screenings of Fair Game, the film of
our fight with the Bush administration. I plan to be in DC through the following Thursday. There are
screenings in Silver Spring on Tuesday at the American Film Institute festival and on Wednesday in
Georgetown as a benefit for the Treatment Action Group, an HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment
organization. You, Potus (ret) and whomever you would like to bring are invited to either or
both. Alternatively, I would be pleased to arrange a private screening for you and your guests either at
your home or elsewhere. Depending on the time, either Valerie or I would be delighted to attend and
answer questions afterwards.
If these dates do not work for you, I am also happy to ensure that a screening is arranged whenever is

Eyes on Hillary Clinton as She Leads Mideast Peace Talks
Opinions Are Split on Whether Secretary of State Has Skills Necessary for Negotiations
By JAKE TAPPER
WASHINGTON, Sept. 2, 2010 —
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton today stepped into the international spotlight, assuming the day-to-day
responsibility of trying to broker a Mideast peace that has eluded her predecessors for decades.
Seated between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the
State Department, Clinton heralded the first direct negotiations between the parties in nearly two years.
Whether both sides can overcome a history of failed negotiations and dashed hopes will depend in large part on
the individual leaders making difficult concessions, Clinton said.
""We cannot and will not impose a solution. Only you can make the decisions necessary to reach an agreement
and secure a peaceful future for the Israeli and Palestinian people,"" she said.
Clinton appeared to embrace the opportunity and the symbolism of the moment 0 speaking slowly and
authoritatively, embracing her partners on both sides, and reminding the world of the difficulties to be expected
on the road ahead.
""Those who oppose the cause of peace will try in every way possible to sabotage this process, as we have
already seen this week,"" she said, referring to the killing Tuesday of four Israeli civilians by Hamas.
But ""the core issues at the center of these negotiations -- territory, security, Jerusalem, refugees, settlements and
others -- will get no easier if we wait, nor will they resolve themselves.""",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr
5948,2010-09-16T04:00:00+00:00,"CAIRO (Reuters) - The Arab League backs the Palestinians' refusal to continue direct peace talks if Israel resumes building
settlements, the organization's chief said September 16. ""If settlement construction does not stop, then there is no use
for continuing negotiations,"" Amr Moussa told a press conference, saying this was the opinion of the Arabs and
Palestinian President Abbas. ""Negotiating with occupation is simply a waste of time.""",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

American national, wearing a shirt and grey pants and carrying a 40-kg

seconds to recognize him. He was no other than the new U.S. Ambassador to
Pakistan, Mr. Cameron Munter. During my recent visit to the United States,
I had the chance to meet him at the residence of our Ambassador in
Washington, Mr. Hussain Haqqani. In a lighter vein, he (Ambassador Munter)
asked me and other Pakistani journalists, present on the occasion, that
'please don't pester me during my stay in Pakistan because I am very
scared of the Pakistani media even now in my own country.' These words
garnered a resounding laughter from all of us. It was my first meeting
with Ambassador Munter. Now he is in Pakistan where the U.S. Ambassador is
always more busy even than the host country's president. Within a week
after his arrival in Pakistan, the U.S. Ambassador reached Sukkur along
with relief goods for the flood-affected people who are still languishing
in makeshift tents. To the much astonishment of common Pakistanis, he,
along with other ordinary officials, started unloading the relief goods
with his own hands, and all major newspapers of the country gave front-",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Americans Most Likely to Favor GOP
Newcomers for Congress
Three in four believe influx of new members would improve
Congress
by Jeffrey M. Jones
PRINCETON, NJ -- It appears that the best type of candidate to be this fall is a Republican challenger. Given a choice of
four hypothetical candidates of differing party affiliations and experience, Americans are most likely to prefer ""a
Republican who has not served in Congress."" Those who would prefer a Democratic candidate opt for an incumbent over
a newcomer.
These results, based on an Aug. 27-30 USA Today/Gallup poll, underscore the advantageous political environment for
Republicans and non-incumbents this midterm election season. Overall, a majority of Americans prefer a Republican
candidate (regardless of experience) to a Democrat, 53% to 40%. And a majority also prefer a non-incumbent (regardless
of party affiliation) to an incumbent, 54% to 39%.
The fact that Americans who prefer a Republican candidate want one who is new to Congress suggests that these voters
want both GOP control of Congress and the new perspectives that come from members with no prior Washington
experience. Americans who favor Democratic candidates, on the other hand, apparently are more satisfied with the type
of experienced representatives now in Congress.
One would naturally expect Democrats to prefer Democratic candidates, and Republicans to prefer Republican
candidates, and that is the case when looking at the data by party. But partisans' preferences for incumbents versus
challengers seem to be influenced by their knowledge that the Democrats currently have a majority in Congress, and thus,
more Democrats will be defending House seats this fall. Democrats are more likely to prefer a Democrat who is in
Congress to a Democrat who is not, and Republicans are more likely to prefer a Republican outside of Congress to one
who is currently serving there. Independents also show a strong preference for Republican non-incumbents.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

You were amazing yesterday. Will look for direction on details for the upcoming talks.Dear Capricia,
As time moves on, I realize I haven't seen you and Mrs. Clinton (Hillary) in a long time, but I think of you both often. I
don't know if movie producers are still worthy in your world, but next time you're in NYC I'd love to see you.
I have such fond memories of you guys watching SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE. I made another movie you might like about the
ascendancy of King George after Edward abdicated, it's called KINGS SPEECH. The movie brings to light something that
many people don't know, which is that King George was a stutterer and he hired an actor to try and help him overcome
it. It's a fun movie that is much in the tradition of SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, again I think you would both like it (and
Hillary would approve because it's PG-13 with not too many swear words).
If you have any trips coming up I'd love to send it to you so you guys can watch and give me your opinion. I could also
include a copy of THE TILLMAN STORY, that one is obviously not a happy film, but it's an incredibly important one.
PS
Your bad friend,
Harvey

Madame Secretary,
I wanted to follow-up with you on my earlier note about the security situation in Monterrey. We have been working
very closely with Pat Kennedy to assess all of our options. Pat has shown tremendous flexibility and has provided
excellent counsel.
As we looked further into the Aug 20 shooting incident at the American School, it became clear that there many
competing versions about the causes behind the incident. We decided that it is best to leave this matter to local law
enforcement officials and to concentrate our review on whether it is possible to provide adequate security for the
children of U.S. personnel in Monterrey.
Our discussions with police and other security officials made clear that local police and private patrols do not have the
capacity to deter gangs and cartels from areas around the schools attended by the children of U.S. personnel. Local
authorities, we found, are not able to respond in a predictable and effective manner to calls for assistance. Given the
increasing level of violence that is occurring all over Monterrey, including near where our children go to school, we
determined that the only immediate, practical, and reliable way to reduce the security risks for all children is to relocate
them to the United States.
We are working with Pat Kennedy on the appropriate mechanism to formalize these arrangements. I have also advised
Secretary Espinosa and Nuevo Leon Governor Medina that we are moving in this direction. In parallel with this, I
recommitted to our Mexican counterparts that we will continue to do everything possible to support their efforts to
improve the security environment in Monterrey and other parts of the country.

6050,2010-11-19T05:00:00+00:00,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel insisted November 18 it would keep building homes in disputed east Jerusalem, threatening to
hold up a U.S.-proposed settlement construction moratorium designed to renew deadlocked Mideast peacemaking.
The contours of the moratorium deal, as presented by Israeli officials after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned
from the U.S. last week, had appeared to be clearly agreed upon.
Washington, they said, had agreed to exclude the eastern sector of the holy city from the 90-day moratorium and there
would be no further demands for construction curbs in the West Bank when the latest moratorium expired.
On November 18, however, a day after Netanyahu said a deal was imminent, the U.S. still had not sent a promised letter
detailing the understandings on the proposed moratorium.
In Washington, a senior Obama administration official said the U.S. and Israel were still ""haggling"" over details of the
written assurances. The official said most of the unresolved issues were relatively routine but added that it was unlikely
that the letter would be finished Thursday.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter,
said it was not clear when the letter might be completed.
In a speech November 18, Netanyahu suggested agreement was neither imminent nor inevitable.
He said he has been holding intensive contacts with the Obama administration since his meeting with U.S. Secretary of
State Hillary Rodham Clinton a week ago.
""The objective is to formulate understandings through which we can promote the political process while maintaining the
vital interests of the state of Israel, primarily security,"" Netanyahu told students at the Technion, a technology school. ""If
I accept such an offer from the U.S. government I will bring it before the Cabinet and I have no doubt that my fellow
ministers will accept it.""
Earlier November 18, Netanyahu spokesman Mark Regev said any future moratorium would not apply to Jerusalem,
whose eastern sector was annexed by Israel in 1967 in a move not recognized by the international community.
He noted that an earlier settlement slowdown, whose expiration in September led to the current impasse in peace
efforts, did not include Jerusalem.

Thank you; We, group of women leaders met with Secretary Clinton. It was a short meeting,
introduction and photo opportunity. But, I hope the event send a message to our
government that women should be supported. I also think that the Embassy will consider more
vision of women of Kosova.
Secretary Clinton was just remarkable. Her message for our, also Belgrade leadership was clear
and strait forward; dialogue, dialogue, dialogue as two independent states!
The admiration expressed by the population in the streets as motorcade was passing, meeting
with PM and acting President, open meeting with students and media was impressive. She is
really inspiration for all.
Maybe was not a right time, but I only wish she has pressed the PM on corruption practices.
Thank you once again for facilitating this meeting.
Best regards,
VjosaShe is eager to see you. The embassy told me that they talked to you and you're able to see her.Thanks for replying to the message.
My phone number isDear Melanne,
Hope this message finds you well.
I am trying to follow your work and every time I run into information that involves you as a
speaker or presenter, I know that strong advocacy for the benefit of women is coming for the
future.
I am starting a foundation, with a objective to advocate policies on health, environment and
human rights. Women in the region have serious obstacles to access health care and services,
and are suffering from a luck of information. Many preventable diseases are taking its toll
because of the lack of information and facilities, especially regarding breast cancer and cervical
cancer. Also, laws on health care do not require for preventive services such as mammography,
pap smear and other preventive services. I am planning to work on different level, not excluding
other target groups but starting with women.
Today, media have announce the visit of Secretary Hillary Clinton in the region, including
Kosovo. Is there any chance to meet with her during short visit in Prishtina? I know she is
coming to assist the dialogue between Prishtina and Belgrade, but she would be even more
helpful if she meets me and other women.
New early elections are coming in few months and she would bust our confidence and would
support better participation of women and better election result.
I am afraid that our government officials are going to meet alone and/or be very selective who
can meet her because is going to have impact on the election.
I am not with any political party but would be wonderful and extremely helpful for the support",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Europe's New Politics of Fear
by Denis MacShaneApril 16, 2010
There is a new divide in Europe. Not an iron curtain, but an iron intolerance as politicians revert to blaming minorities for
their nations' woes. In Western Europe it is Muslims. In Eastern Europe they are Jews, Roma, and gays. In the
Netherlands, Geert Wilders surged to an election victory in March on the back of anti-Muslim, anti-Quran populism. In
Hungary the Fidesz Party won big in recent elections with attacks on ""Jewish capital... which wants to devour the entire
world."" To the right of Fidesz is the openly anti-Jewish Jobbik Party, which won just two seats fewer than the Socialists. Its
leaders want to wear the neo-Nazi uniform of the pre-1939 Hungarian Guard when they take their seats in Budapest's
Parliament.
Contemporary political scientists do not like to highlight anti-Semitism. They prefer the term ""radical populism,"" but to
anyone with half a sense of European history, the parallels with an older, Jew-baiting politics can no longer be dismissed.
Economic dislocation and a rapid loss of confidence in traditional politics gave rise to ultranationalist movements in the
first half of the last century. Now a global recession and the hunt for someone to blame as jobs and incomes disappear is
producing the same toxic politics.
The Fidesz leader, Viktor Orban, was a youthful evangelist for liberalized open markets after 1990. Now he strikes a much
more nationalist tone. His Socialist opponents had to accept an austerity IMF package. Unlike Greece—which is being
helped, so far, by its euro-zone partners—Hungary was alone as boom-time euro loans to buy houses and cars had to be
paid back in an ever-devaluing forint. Blaming the Socialist government, globalization, and international capital was easy.
But Fidesz went further. In a bid for votes on the far right, a Fidesz parliamentarian, Oszkar Molnar, says it's time to give
""primacy to Hungarian interests over those of global capital, Jewish capital.""
Like Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front in France, Jobbik has the support of about 15 percent of Hungarian voters. The
Czech right-wing ODS Party has had to dismiss its leader, former premier Mirek Topolanek, after he attacked the Jewish
origins of the current Czech prime minister and castigated the gay transport minister. In a new book, The Populist Radical",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

6137,2010-10-01T04:00:00+00:00,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Osama bin Laden emerged October 1 as possibly a key figure in the European terror plot, and
officials said he may be flexing his muscles in a move to show a besieged al-Qaida remains strong and able to launch
major attacks on western targets. U.S. counterterrorism officials said they believe that senior al-Qaida leaders, including
bin Laden, were involved in the plan to strike several European cities in a coordinated assault. If bin Laden had a direct
hand in the planning, it would be the most active role he has played in a terror plot since the 9/11 attacks, according to
U.S. officials and analysts.
Counterterrorism officials said that they are now working under the assumption that bin Laden played a role in the
plotting, but they would not detail what indications they've seen that led them in that direction.
Still, some also believe that bin Laden's orders may have been delivered by one of his top commanders, since the al-
Qaida leader is known to avoid close contact with anyone except his closet confidants.
While bin Laden's name is still a powerful reminder of the World Trade Center's twin towers and the Pentagon
engulfed in flames, U.S. officials have for months asserted both in private and in hearings on Capitol Hill that his core al-
Qaida group is weakened, struggling to raise money and attract recruits.
""Clearly there is a great deal of pressure on al-Qaida to do something to show that it is still alive and kicking,"" said
Richard Barrett, the head of a U.N. group that monitors the threat posed by al-Qaida and the Taliban. ""They need to
show they're strong, they're a force multiplier, that they've still got some beef, that they've got operators abroad, that
they can do things.""
Barrett said al-Qaida's Pakistan-based network has not launched a successful attack since the London subway
bombing in 2005. ""In order to attract the younger new recruits, I think they have to do a bit better than that,"" he said.
The multi-pronged scope of the emerging terror plan _ which aimed to launch coordinated shooting rampages or
attacks in Britain, France and Germany _ is an al-Qaida hallmark.
U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, declined to reveal what evidence
they have that bin Laden took a more prominent role in this plan. And one U.S. intelligence official cautioned that the
details of how the plan was directed or coordinated by the group's core leaders is not yet clear.
The involvement of bin Laden and his devoted leaders, believed to be in hiding in Pakistan, underscores continuing
U.S. concerns about that country's role as a safe haven for al-Qaida and other Islamic extremists.
And it reflects al-Qaida's persistent effort _ through video and online messages _ to inspire its followers to wage
attacks against the West. The threat to Europe was highlighted when bin Laden issued a call to arms in March 2008 after
a Danish newspaper printed controversial cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad.
He warned Europeans in an audio message that there would be a ""severe"" reaction to come.
Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., the senior Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said that bin Laden may
simply be trying to re-exert himself. And his role in the European plot could suggest a lack of confidence by al-Qaida
central in the ability of other affiliated groups in Yemen or Africa to carry out a successful attack on their own, Hoekstra
said.
Over the past year, several terror attacks in the U.S. have either failed or been foiled, including the botched attempts
to bring down a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day and to set off a bomb in New York's Time Square.
""They've let other people take the lead on attacking the West,"" said Hoekstra, adding that bin Laden may now be",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Palestinians Say Talks With Israel Should Be Suspended
By ETHAN BRONNER
New York Times
RAMALLAH, West Bank — The Palestinian leadership said Saturday that four-week-old direct talks with Israel should be suspended as
long as Jewish settlement housing was being built in the West Bank. It called on the international community to pressure Israel to stop
the construction.
A statement issued after a meeting of about 35 Palestinian leaders — the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
the central committee of the main Fatah movement and a handful of others — held at the compound of the Palestinian Authority
president, Mahmoud Abbas, said that Israel was responsible for the deadlock.
""The leadership confirms that the resumption of talks requires tangible steps, the first of them a freeze on settlements,""Yasser Abed
Rabb°, a senior P.L.O. official said after the three-hour meeting. ""The Palestinian leadership holds Israel responsible for obstructing the
negotiations.""
The Obama administration envoy to the region, George J. Mitchell, met repeatedly in recent days with Mr. Abbas and Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in hopes of keeping the new talks alive. But he left on Friday, having made no progress.
Mr. Mitchell remains in the region, talking with Arab leaders before an Arab League meeting planned for next Friday in Libya, where
the issue of direct talks with Israel will be debated and where, Mr. Abbas has said, a final decision on the future of the talks will be
made.
Barring a last-minute deal, the talks seemed to be in deep trouble.
Mr. Abbas was due to see King Hussein of Jordan on Sunday and then Hosni Mubarak, the president of Egypt, as efforts continue to
find a solution.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Effort for Liberal Balance to G.O.P. Groups
Begins
By MICHAEL LUO
In what may prove a significant development for the 2012 elections, David Brock, a prominent Democratic political
operative, says he has amassed $4 million in pledges over the last few weeks and is moving quickly to hire a staff to set
up what he hopes will become a permanent liberal counterweight over the airwaves to the Republican-leaning outside
groups that spent so heavily on this year's midterm elections.
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, a former Maryland lieutenant governor and the eldest of Robert F. Kennedy's 11 children,
has agreed to serve as the chairwoman of the group, which will be called American Bridge, lending to the still extremely
nascent undertaking the weight of what remains one of the most significant families in Democratic politics.
Leading Democratic donors who have already pledged money to the group include Rob McKay, heir to the Taco Bell
fortune and chairman of the Democracy Alliance, a partnership of wealthy liberal donors; Robert Dyson, who heads
Dyson-Kissner-Moran, a takeover and acquisitions firm in New York City; and Marcia L. Carsey, a television producer who
gave $1 million to Democratic outside groups in 2004.
Mr. Brock said in an interview that he planned to formally file papers with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday to
set up American Bridge as what is known as an independent-expenditure-only political action committee, meaning it will
be able to take in contributions of unlimited size from individuals and corporations but must regularly disclose its donors.
Certain to set off debate, however, is that Mr. Brock appears to be positioning his new organization so that fund-raising
consultants can raise money for Democratic-oriented media efforts not just through American Bridge but also via one of
the nonprofit organizations Mr. Brock currently runs, Media Matters Action Network, which does not disclose its donors.
The action network, which tracks conservative politicians and advocacy organizations, is organized as a 501(c)(4)
nonprofit group and is set to take on an expanded role in the 2012 elections, including potentially running television ads,
according to an internal draft concept paper about American Bridge's and Media Matter Action Network's plans obtained
by The New York Times.
Mr. Brock said that ""money is money,"" and that he would actively solicit donors for both entities and, in the end, the media
spending would be apportioned accordingly.
The moves by Mr. Brock in recent weeks make his the most concrete effort so far on the part of Democratic activists to
establish some kind of centralized structure that they hope will become the left's answer in 2012 to such groups on the
right as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, American Crossroads and others, which significantly outspent Democratic-
leaning outside groups this year. It is too early to say whether Mr. Brock's group will emerge as the go-to vehicle for giant
contributions on the left.
Mr. Brock led a much-heralded independent group in the 2008 presidential election that failed to gain much traction after
the Obama campaign indicated that it preferred that donors not give to such groups.
But Mr. Brock, a former conservative journalist who publicly disavowed the right in the late 1990s, is a respected political
player, who has drawn plaudits from liberal donors for his running of the array of groups under the Media Matters
umbrella.
Mr. Brock pointed out that the various groups associated with Media Matters had raised a combined $23 million this year.
Its backers include major Democratic donors like George Soros, the billionaire who recently announced he had given $1",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Madame Secretary,
A shoot out occurred on August 20 in front of the American School in Monterrey (AFSM), resulting in the death of two
bodyguards. An investigation is continuing into the details, but our understanding at this point is that it was an
attempted kidnapping targeting the relatives of a local business executive. While it does not appear that U.S. families
were targeted, the sharp increase in kidnapping incidents in the Monterrey area, and this event in particular, present a
very high risk to the families of U.S. citizens who might be become incidental victims.
U.S. security and law enforcement personnel have engaged local and federal security officials to seek their help on
understanding the immediate risks and measures that can be taken. I have urged U.S. families at the Consulate in
Monterrey not to send their children to school in the coming days while we review the events that took place on August
20. We also are advising U.S. citizens in the area that we have urged Consulate personnel not to send their children to
school while we complete this security review.
I am sure that the warden notice will lead to a rash of press reports on U.S. concerns about security in Monterrey. More
broadly, if the government cannot get the kidnappings in Monterrey under control, that may affect our ability to
function in Monterrey. I have advised Secretary Espinosa of this, and have sought her help as well to address consulate
security.
Consulate personnel are currently on ""authorized departure"" and have the option to send their families to a U.S.
location. Pat Kennedy is in close touch on these matters.

a deal that put Maliki, a Shiite, on track for a second term as premier. The power-sharing pact, more than eight months
after an inconclusive March 7 parliamentary election, offered some hope that Iraq could avoid a return to the sectarian
warfare that killed tens of thousands of people at its peak in 2006-07. The deal gave Talabani, a Kurd, another term as

By JACK HEALY
BAGHDAD — Prime Minister Nuni Kamal al-Maliki, seeking to show that he is in control of a tenuous new
ruling coalition, said Saturday that he would push ahead to form a new government with or without potential
allies, and that there was no need for American troops to remain in Iraq past a December 2011 deadline for
withdrawal.
In his first news conference since being formally nominated as prime minister two days ago, Mr. Maliki
acknowledged the growing frustration of Iraqis, who have watched their leaders collect salaries of up to $11,000
a month and fly off to their second homes while in much of the country's electricity remains sporadic and
violent attacks continue.
Mr. Maliki's remarks also reflected the splinters that remained inside Iraq's nascent partnership government,
and the competing interests of political groups that have coalesced behind him.
There is no need for American troops to remain in Iraq beyond December 2011, Mr. Maliki said, apparently in a
nod to the followers of the anti-American Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, who have promised to fight any
attempt to maintain an American military presence here.
The Sadrists have played a critical role in supporting Mr. Maliki for a second term after indecisive elections in
March. Some American and Iraqi officials have argued that a residual force is necessary to continue training
Iraqi soldiers and help maintain military equipment, but on Saturday, Mr. Maliki said the Iraqis could stand
alone.
""I don't see a need for any other international forces to help Iraqis control the security situation,"" he said.
Iraqi officials announced Saturday that they had arrested 12 people who orchestrated a bloody siege against a
Christian church here last month. They called the arrests evidence of improvements in the country's security
forces.
Interior Ministry officials said the insurgents had ties to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, and had also planned to also
blow up the main gates of the International Zone, where the United States Embassy is located. Officials said
they had seized 6 suicide belts, 10 improvised explosive devices and 5 tons of bomb-making material as a result
of the arrests.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

of a new arms control treaty with Russia is so pressing that it must be dealt with by the lame-duck Senate. Senator Jon
Kyl of Arizona said Sunday that the Senate has much more urgent business to attend to in the weeks before it breaks for
Christmas. He said the treaty, known as New START, is extremely complex and can wait until the Senate reconvenes
with newly elected members in January. The Obama administration has said ratification is an urgent national security

I'd like to discuss next week.Here is the link to the video of The Arc. http://friendsofthearc.org/, a national infrastructure trunkline for a future
Palestinian State developed by the RAND Corporation. It is only 8 minutes long, but a great overview of the Arc vision
and its potential for enabling peace in the region. I promise you it is worth it. It has tested very well with both
Palestinians, Israelis and American Jews and Palestinians. It is a genuinely a transformational idea that did not originate
from American politicians or diplomats, but rather from innovative American minds in collaboration with stakeholders
from all walks of life in Palestine, Israel, the US, Europe, and the Muslim world. And it could be largely financed with
private finance.
AMOriginal MessageOriginal MessageMs. Slaughter,
Again, great talk today at the CNAS annual event. Thanks for your time.
As you will remember, I raised the point that we seem not to be engaging
regimes or populations regarding affirmative visions of what their
societies
could achieve in (say) a decade, if only we invested in a certain
development strategy.
Clearly, you had once heard about the RAND Corporation's Arc Concept
(perhaps from Steve Simon?), for a national infrastructure trunkline for
a
future Palestinian State. To regain familiarity, please watch the 8
minute
video on the home page of www.friendsofthearc.org which provides a great
overview of the Arc vision, and its potential for enabling peace in the
region. This is an affirmative vision that sells very well to both
Palestinians, Israelis and American Jews and Palestinians. I would be
happy
to prove this. Just imagine if the US came out in support of this
vision.
If President Obama simply said something like ""The Arc is a great
example of
a transformational idea which did not originate from American
politicians or
diplomats, but rather from innovative American minds in collaboration
with
stakeholders from all walks of life in Palestine, Israel, the US,
Europe,
and the Muslim world. It's the kind of initiative that I am happy to
endorse, and I look forward to better understanding how, through the
Arc,
America can make a positive contributions to peace, prosperity and
security
in the region."" - some very interesting things would happen. For
example,
the PIF and other forms of private finance might just finance the whole
thing...not requiring any (or at least much) US $.
You don't know me from Adam, but lets just say that I can say with
confidence that PM Fayyad backs the Arc as a key part of his two year
plan
for statehood, and that Abu Mazen's economic advisor (Dr. Mohammad
Mustafa -
CEO of the PIF) does also. And, that President Peres has been a long

This is not like the Pentagon Papers or even the videos of the bombings, this is a wholesale capturing of the diplomatic

confidential — Ithink this is unprecedented in history. And if this is wikileaks can get, what can the Chinese or other able
to secure?
The issues surrounding the content are significant and could have legs.
But this security breach is not a targeted breach to make a whistle blower point, it is a wholesale leak that should be
treated as putting lives in danger. For what it is worth, I think you need to order a full scale review and upgrading of the
cyber security of the state department immediately. To offer a bounty for the capture of those responsible. And as I see
you doing, take an aggressive position on Wikileaks. Just being seen as apologizing for the content is weak compared to
reacting and acting to shore up the key principles behind security and aggressively dealing with the problem directly.

The GOP is hiding John Boehner, who is unpopular in his home state of Ohio, where he's best known. To

are not being exposed for their increasing dependence on extremists. They are not being pressed for their

Mir Hossein Mousavi in 2009 presidential election that led to re-election of President Ahmadinejad.

PM to convene inner cabinet on Tuesday for vote on a 60-day moratorium in exchange for U.S. guarantees.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will convene his forum of top ministers on Tuesday afternoon to debate extending
Israel's moratorium on construction in West Bank settlements for 60 days.
The concession would be made in exchange for a series of reported U.S. guarantees in Israel's direct peace negotiations
with the Palestinians. Israel halted construction temporarily for 10 months, a freeze that ended on September 26.
The Palestinians have said they would not continue the recently renewed negotiations unless Israel agreed to halt
construction again. The Obama administration has urged Israel to reconsider its refusal of that demand.
If Netanyahu succeeds in convincing the Forum of Seven to accept an extension of the construction freeze, he plans to
bring the matter to the political-security cabinet for a vote later Tuesday.
Defense Minister Ehud Barak (Labor) and Intelligence and Atomic Energy Minister Dan Meridor (Likud) are expected to
support Netanyahu's position, while Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman (Yisrael Beiteinu) is likely to present the
greatest opposition.
Netanyahu is pinning his hopes now on Ministers Benny Begin (Likud), Moshe Ya'alon (Likud) and Eli Yishai (Shas). The
prime minister has already met with Begin over the last few days in an attempt to convince him to change his previously
expressed opposition to extending the freeze.

Fauzia Galani is one of the few female candidates standing for election in September
The bodies of five people working for a female candidate in Afghanistan's parliamentary election have been found in western Herat
province.
They were among a group of 10 people kidnapped by armed men on Wednesday. Five were later released, say reports.
The Taliban later said they carried out the abductions. No group has said it carried out the killings.
The staff were working for Fauzia Galani, who is seeking re-election to parliament in September's polls.
Police chief Nisar Ahmad Popal said the bodies had been found dumped on a mountainside in Adrskan district.
Reports say their hands had been bound and they had been shot in the head.
Taliban insurgents opposed to the elections in general - and female candidates in particular - have been blamed for the murder of a
number of candidates.
On Saturday, candidate Haji Abdul Manan was shot and killed as he was leaving a mosque on the back of a motorcycle.
The Taliban have also been blamed for the kidnap of four women working at a drug treatment centre in northern Faryab province.
Officials were reported to be negotiating to secure the women's release.
The US has sent an extra 30,000 troops to Afghanistan since December 2009 in an effort to defeat the Taliban.
But the BBC's Quentin Sommerville say that outside the city centres, the campaign of intimidation appears to be working, with many

As we discussed during your salon dinner with Steve Clemons at Nora's, I am developing a practical strategy of
""off-shore/on-shore balancing"" that would involve key USG agencies.
As the attached proposal explains, the new strategy is substantially different from previous historical constructs
in the literature on American grand strategy and offers important advantages to improve our position in
Afghanistan and other regions in the world in the coming years.

1. The Republican Party, despite everything, remains deeply unpopular. (See the second
Ohio poll below.)
2. The Republicans have made the election a referendum on Obama and the Democrats,
succeeding beyond their wildest dreams. (See the first poll below on Obama-Bush
matchup and question 12 in second poll on Ohio voters' recall on who they voted for in
2008, giving McCain a three point margin.)
3. The Republicans have managed to hide their own negatives through the negative
campaign against Obama.
4. The campaign is not being conducted as a contest. The Republicans have succeeded in
making it only about approval of Obama.
5. The GOP is hiding John Boehner, who is unpopular in his home state of Ohio, where he's
best known. To the extent he is known, he is disliked.
6. The Republicans are pretending they offer something new and not really the same old
Republicans, to the extent they make any sort of offer.
7. The Tea Party is deliberately trying to hide its extremism behind a mask of novelty and
now religious rhetoric. (The right wing strategy has been spelled out in detail to a friend
of mine,

8. So far, there is no Democratic campaign to focus on the Republicans and, therefore, no
contest. Republicans are not being exposed for their increasing dependence on extremists.
They are not being pressed for their refusal to denounce extremism. Nor is the Tea Party
being revealed as an extremist takeover movement. Nor is the Republicans' motive for
smearing Obama being identified as a cynical strategy to put Boehner in power.
9. Whatever issue ginned up by Republicans--from illegal immigration to the ""ground zero
mosque""—is not about the issue itself. Everything, but everything, is about making John
Boehner, that old scandal ridden hack Republican, the Speaker. No matter what the

One sappy statement before I fly. Your involvement in the QDDR process has always been extremely helpful. Most of the

made all of us think more deeply. I have been grateful for that approach many times throughout the QDDR.
We've come a long way since that first meeting in which I described this as a ""capabilities review"" and organizational

amount of positive feedback we've received and the eagerness to start implementation are great signs heading into

Thank you again for your inquiry. Here is a background from our Consular Affairs Office on where this
currently stands.
The Office of Children's Issues here at State began working with Mr. Bower in August 2009 when his sons
were abducted by their mother to Egypt notwithstanding a court order from a family court in Massachusetts that
had given the father sole custody of the children. Since then, as you know, Mr. Bower has not been able to see
his children.
On August 31, 2010, Embassy Cairo conducted a welfare visit (the first) with the Bower boys at the Ministry of
Justice. The Government of Egypt played a constructive role in arranging this consular visit. As you may",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

(AFP) –26 minutes ago
WASHINGTON — A Florida pastor at the center of a global storm over plans to burn hundreds of Korans said
Thursday he would likely call off the event if asked to by the Obama administration.
Terry Jones, head of the Dove World Outreach Center, told USA Today he had not been contacted by the White
House, Pentagon or State Department about Saturday's planned ceremony on the anniversary of the September
11 attacks.
If he were ""that would cause us definitely to think it over. That's what we're doing now. I don't think a call from
them is something we would ignore,"" Jones told the daily.
US President Barack Obama on Thursday warned the burning ceremony would be a ""recruitment bonanza"" for
Al-Qaeda, which carried out the 2001 attacks on the United States in which almost 3,00 people died.

""This could increase the recruitment of individuals who'd be willing to blow themselves up in American cities,

Obama weighs in as plan to burn Qurans sparks
debate
Updated 2h 8m ago
By Larry Copeland and Rick Hampson, USA TODAY
GAINESVILLE, Fla. — The Constitution won't let you yell ""fire"" in a crowded theater if there isn't one. It won't let you
utter ""fighting words"" with impunity. But scholars agree it will let a pistol-packing minister of a tiny fundamentalist
church outrage countless Muslims by burning the Quran, a book he says he hasn't read.
Florida preacher Terry Jones prepared for a bonfire of the Qurans on Saturday — the ninth anniversary of the 9/11
terror attacks— despite protests from the White House, the Vatican, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, fellow
Christian evangelicals and veterans' groups.
""As of right now,"" Jones said Wednesday, ""we are not convinced that backing down is the right thing.""
In an interview with USA TODAY he said he had not been contacted by the White House, State Department or Pentagon.
If he were, he said, ""that would cause us to definitely think it over. That's what we're doing now. I don't think a call from
them is something we would ignore.""
Jones' plans for ""International Burn a Koran Day"" at his Dove World Outreach Center provoked a warning this week from
Gen. David Petraeus that U.S. troops in the field could be endangered.
President Obama became the latest to comment in an interview aired Thursday on ABC's Good Morning America. The
president called the plan a ""stunt"" that could ""greatly endanger our young men and women in uniform who are in Iraq,
who are in Afghanistan.""
""This is a recruitment bonanza for Al Qaeda,"" he added.
""We're concerned with troops and missionaries ourselves,"" Jones said. ""Our question is when do we stop backing down.
... In certain areas of our country, we have lost our backbone. We have backed down too much.""",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

In his Sunday op-ed, Chris Smith politicized the broadly-accepted Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
Contrary to Smith's assertions, access to legal abortion will not be on the agenda of the MDG Summit this week in New
York. The key UN document on this issue makes clear that nations have the right to set their own abortion laws. Instead,
world leaders will focus on how to rid the world of extreme poverty and hunger and to make dramatic improvement to the
health of women and children around the globe.
Ensuring access to health services, including modern family planning, can play a critically important role in saving the
lives of women. In fact, it can reduce 40% of maternal deaths worldwide. More than two hundred million women in the
developing world want access to family planning, but can't get it. This has a dramatic impact, increasing deaths during
childbirth, leaving millions of newborns behind.
Listening to the voices of women in the developing world, not injecting American domestic politics into the MDG Summit,
is the surest way to promote the goals on which we can all agree.

Hillary Clinton sends strong message to world
SF Chronicle Editorial Friday, September 10, 2010
Hillary Clinton's blend of diligence, caution and toughness didn't always serve her well as a presidential candidate. But
these attributes make her a powerful secretary of state, the unsung hero for a White House team trying to mend global
fences without looking weak.
In a speech this week, Clinton laid down the law for an audience wondering where Obama is headed on foreign policy.
Would she favor hand-holding with rivals such as China and Russia, a sign that Washington was ducking trouble in the
name of consensus building?
Not at all, suggested Clinton in a lengthy speech to the Council of Foreign Relations. In her diplomatic travels, she found

smartest foreign policy analysts I know, gave the attached speech to the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs in
Oslo on Sept 1, the day before you held the opening peace talks in DC. His speech has been widely circulated on the
Internet since then, so you should at least skim it for that reason alone. It is long, and there are parts of it you will
strongly disagree with, but I would still recommend reading it, above all now. But given your time constraints, in the
attached document I have excerpted the parts I think are most valuable for us and added a few comments of my own
and then included the speech as a whole. In particular, given your interest in Palestinian/Arab psychology and where I
think you personally can make a mark that has eluded others, I would point you to the three excerpted graphs below.
""Arabic has two quite different words that are both translated as ""negotiation,"" making a distinction that doesn't exist in
either English or Hebrew. One word, ""musaawama,"" refers to the no-holds-barred bargaining process that takes place in
bazaars between strangers who may never see each other again and who therefore feel no obligation not to scam each
other. Another, ""mufaawadhat,"" describes the dignified formal discussions about matters of honor and high principle
that take place on a basis of mutual respect and equality between statesmen who seek a continuing relationship.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's travel to Jerusalem was a grand act of statesmanship to initiate a process of
mufaawadhat - relationship-building between leaders and their polities. So was the Arab peace initiative of 2002. It
called for a response in kind. The
West muttered approvingly but did not act. After a while, Israel
responded with intermittent, somewhat oblique suggestions of willingness to haggle over terms. But an offer to bicker
over the terms on which a grand gesture has been granted is, not surprisingly, seen as insultingly unresponsive.
I [this is Freeman talking] cite this not to suggest that non-Arabs should adopt Arabic canons of thought, but to make a
point about diplomatic effectiveness. To move a negotiating partner in a desired direction, one must understand how
that partner understands things and help him to see a way forward that will bring him to an end he has been persuaded
to want. One of the reasons we can't seem to move things as we desire in the Middle East is that we don't make much
effort to understand how others reason and how they rank their interests.""",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Ambassador about helping them. I'm copying Judith and asking that the two of you discuss what we could do given the
very difficult political landscape.
Thx for all your good counsel. We need to follow thru on the campaign for women we discussed some months back. Are
you still assisting Melanne? Let me know what I can do to hurry it along. HMme Secretary:
I'm glad I got to see you at Raj's swearing-in. Hope you liked the speech. Alonzo said we hit the right notes and Raj is off
to a strong start.
Of course I was kidding about ""running away"" from your ""long list"" of things you wanted to talk about with me. I'm
happy to talk anytime.
In fact, it would be good to touch base on the women's initiative and Pakistan. I've been talking with ND1's highly
regarded country director in Pakistan, who says communications is a desperate need and will definitely do some good
for the government.
Look forward to seeing you again soon. All the best, Doug

and amounted to a series of generalisms. We felt that a more specific topic would allow for a sharper message. We
selected democracy because it allows you to talk about a broad and relevant trend that cuts across global affairs; to
reprise signature themes like Internet freedom, civil society, and the democracy/development nexus; and to underscore
that this administration takes these issues seriously. This was also an element of your CFR speech and provides some
continuity in that respect as well. We were not looking to break new ground but rather to reinforce.Here's some background: This piece is for a year-ending look-ahead issue of The Economist and we were asked to write
about America's priorities and place in the world in 2011, ten years after 9/11 and twenty years after the end of the Cold
War. The team (Jake, Josh, Anne-Marie, Derek) felt that this was a good opportunity to pull together for a wide audience
some of the key themes you sounded in Krakow and elsewhere, and build on the President's call to action at UNGA. We
don't say anything new here, its true, but the idea was to lay down another marker that these are issues that are
important to you and to the administration.Schwerin, Daniel B B6

6563,2010-01-10T05:00:00+00:00,"What else can I do to help?Google has been wierd about this whole deal but this whole Espo experience has been fascinating. Some companies will
say absolutely no for months (Qualcomm, Bloomberg, .1&.1) and then pop out of nowhere and say yes. Others like All are
in for and then decide not to give us a penny. Therefore we have to keep bugging these guys.
We WILL raise the money. We are at $54M+ (this wk Hawaii came in for $500k and Bloomberg LLC and need $7M
more. Ideally we would like to raise $10 to 11M to cover any overruns (it's getting more expensive because the US was
so late we are paying more now to build it quicker).
Where it will come from?
A- Right now we have three big companies talking to us in the range of each - Monsanto, Disney, and Oracle.
Haier may go from If two or three come thru big we are done.
B- We also have a number of other companies like Invitrogen, Hormel, Mattel and Major League Baseball in the
range.
C- Interestingly the cities and states are going to their private funders and trying to raise money on their own to
promote their jurisdictions - Chicago, Houston, Georgia, Montana, TN. (In the past, over 20 states participated with
public funds but current budgets are tough). Maybe a chat w Mayor Bloomberg would be worthwhile. For example, I
spoke to the University of WA and they will probably get benefactors to cosponsor at $250k making them the only
university represented.
D- We have approached groups like Pharma and the fashion industry thru Diane von Furstenburg to get them to bundle
smaller companies and both have agreed to do it. I met w DVL and she wants you to know that she is very excited about
helping (they are in the range).
E-We have talked to the elusive Chamber of Commerce again about getting SME's to raise $2-3M in smaller increments.
They are contemplating it.
Finally the two obvious industries that are not involved are the banks (and we know why) and the insurance companies
who are starting to look into the market over there.
Anyway, I did not mean to go on and on but that's where we stand and these are the potential areas to tap. We'll get
there.I don't think I made any progress. What will it mean if we can't raise the remaining 5? Where else can we try?
Do you know howI noticed on your schedule that you are meeting with a number of tech CEO's this evening. Google should be an obvious
co-sponsor of the USA Pavilion and they have consistently pushed us off. Although they bring up IP issues as a reason
not to participate, the Chinese frequently note that they do a lot of business in China. We are now at $54 million. If the
opportunity arises, it would be helpful to note the importance of a USA standing in Shanghai.",kris.balderston@univ-tlse3.fr

Hello and Happy New Year Jim,
Friends of WFP has decided to provide its annual ""Leadership in the Fight Against Hunger"" Award to Secretary Clinton
this year. The award is presented at a ceremony on Capitol Hill (within one of the House/Senate caucus rooms).
Approximately 200 people attend the event including Members of Congress, NGO representatives, business leaders,
administration officials and other leaders in the fight against hunger.
As you know, Friends of WFP is a non-profit organization dedicated to addressing global hunger. Its board members
include former agriculture secretary Dan Glickman, former Senators George McGovern and Bob Dole, YUM Brands CEO
David Novak, former NSC Advisor Sandy Berger and others. I established the organization in 1997.
Before officially announcing Secretary Clinton as this year's award recipient, we hoped to confirm that Secretary Clinton
will be available to personally accept the award. We plan to schedule the award ceremony in September on either aFriends,
As 2009 comes to a close, we wanted to provide you with an update on the U.S. Global Hunger and Food Security
Initiative and share with you what is to come in the new year.
First, a word of thanks for the input that many of you provided on our Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative
consultation document. We received a large amount of interest and excellent suggestions on the document, and we will
soon release a new version that reflects this input.
We are also drafting an implementation plan that will describe in greater detail how we intend to implement the
initiative. We look forward to sharing both documents with you.
In recent months, we have continued to garner international support for the five core principles for global food security
that form the basis of our strategy. In November, all UN member states endorsed these principles at the World Summit
on Food Security in Rome.
1) Invest in country-owned plans
2) Foster strategic coordination
3) Strive for a comprehensive approach to food security
4) Ensure a strong role for the multilateral system
5) Ensure sustained and substantial commitment by all partners to investment in agriculture and food security and
nutrition
In establishing the Rome Principles, the international community declared a new business model for coordinated action
to increase global food security.",cheryl.mills@univ-tlse3.fr

JMJudith:
I hope you've been well. Following up on the Secretary's request, when would you like to regroup about
communications support in Pakistan?
As food for thought, I've been talking with She's a great source of insight and
information on the ground, with a valuable independent perspective. She is very tuned into the government's
communications challenges and opportunities.
In her view, while the need is more urgent than ever, the government does have positive programs and policies that
would generate good will if people knew about them. Communications seems to suffer both from a lack of perspective -
politicians are obsessed with politics in the capital, rather than the needs of people at the grassroots - and a lack of both
practical expertise and proactive strategy. They need a plan for publicizing initiatives that benefit people, as well as
hands-on training and support to execute effectively.
This sounds very similar to the situation my team dealt with in Lebanon, where we worked with the government,
political parties and NG0s. We learned not to let a state of crisis be an obstacle to moving forward with a
communications program - they're always in crisis and, as you know, effective communications is part of the long-term
solution.
I know there may be concern about working with US consultants. One approach would be to work through NDI, which
has great contacts and credibility on the ground. That's how we did it in Lebanon.Raj is off to a brilliant start and thank you for the help_you provided him.
We share your assessment of Pakistan's need for a public narrative and better capacity to communicate effectively.

Pls print.Dear Hillary,
I wanted to pass on some thoughts we are formulating on how to address the global burden of chronic disease and get
your input We could have a short call about this if you have time..
I have been thinking about how Paul Farmer created a whole movement around infectious disease globally and how we
can apply that to chronic disease -- and yes - I would love to meet him and talk with him about this problem.
So here's the problem.
1. By 2020 global mortality from chronic disease will claim 50 million lives compared to 20 million for communicable or
infectious disease and currently mortality in DEVELOPING WORLD is 29 million people a year from chronic disease.
2. As you know in the US, chronic disease care (usually at end stage in acute settings) accounts for almost 80% of health
care expenditures. This is likely to increase globally and in developing countries because countries like India have
diabetes rates of 25%. Mortality from heart disease in China in 35 to 44 year olds has increased 300% in the last few
decades.
3. Global Funding for prevention and treatment of the causes of chronic disease doesn't match the disease burden by
an unacceptable margin.
4. Less than 5% of funding from governments, NGO's, private foundations is for chronic disease (i.e. World Bank - $4.5
billion to health sector work, 2.5% for non-communicable disease and Global Fund focuses only on HIV/AIDS, malaria> Dear Hillary,",lauren.jiloty@univ-tlse3.fr
6598,2010-10-09T04:00:00+00:00,"IRAQ BURIN (AP) - Palestinians say extremist Jews damaged their olive trees close to a West Bank village as the yearly
harvest of the important crop begins. Resident Bilal Eid said that two dozen men from a nearby Jewish settlement tore
at about a dozen trees after trying to attack Palestinians bulldozing an access road to their fields. The attack came at the
beginning of the 40-day Palestinian olive harvest. It's traditionally a time of heightened violence, as a minority of
extremist Jews try to provoke Palestinians. Eid said the damage could kill the trees, which were meant to be harvested
this week, near the village of Burin. A military spokeswoman said Israeli forces ordered the Jewish intruders to leave.

by Samuel A. Worthington
The work that relief and humanitarian organizations carry out in Pakistan is far from easy or safe. We go to
difficult areas and are targets for militants seeking to destroy our lifesaving mission through a campaign of
killing, kidnapping and intimidation.
Overtly branding our efforts as sponsored by the U.S. government — as the Obama administration wants us
to do — only makes our jobs harder and more dangerous.
I have the privilege of leading InterAction, an alliance of U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations
conducting relief work around the world; nearly a quarter of our 200 members are responding to the recent
floods in Pakistan, and many of them have been in Pakistan for decades.
Though our efforts are supported by public donations, much of the assistance we deliver — whether food,
water, essential health care or education — comes via funding from the U.S. government. And in recent
weeks, the Obama administration has pressured us to make that link as clear and public as possible. Secretary
of State Hillary Rodham Clinton questioned our courage, suggesting last month that some NGOs are too
""afraid to have association with the U.S. government"" while distributing aid in Pakistan.
None of the NGO workers in Pakistan — living under a daily threat of kidnappings or targeted killings — are
cowards. The dangers they face are immense, and their bravery must be commended as they help people
whose lives have been devastated by terrorism or the epic floods.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr cheryl.mills@univ-tlse3.fr philippe.reines@univ-tlse3.fr jake.sullivan@univ-tlse3.fr

Mills, Cheryl DDear Hillary and all.
We arrived at the general hospital last night with 1500 people sick or dying with 40 percent needing surgery. It has no
water electricity or food and very limited surgical suites or supplies It the largest and most well known public hospital in
the city and according to PIH and paul farmer needs to be supported and it's infrastucture needs to be rebuilt.
Right now we have surgeons but not enough operating rooms set up. We
desperately need to get a generator and fuel and surgical lights and surgery supplies not just first aid. There are
hundreds including children with festering wounds needing amputation and emergency
surgical care. The doctors nurses and patients have no food or water.
Can you help get the infrastructure of electricity water and a medical hospital tent for post op patients. We are
operating with headlamps and hacksaws rinsed with alcohol.",cheryl.mill@univ-tlse3.fr cheryl.mills@univ-tlse3.fr rajiv.shah@univ-tlse3.fr

6659,2010-10-15T04:00:00+00:00,"Declan,
Thanks for your email. Of course it's not personal. But I do think it's
wrong.
When we were in Government we believed we could only succeed if we treated
Northern Ireland as a bi-partisan issue and I encouraged other Governments
to adopt the same approach. That meant when President Bush was in the White
House, I went out of my way always to see and brief Democrats - in Congress
and in the Senate - whenever I came to the States. It also meant when we
held the first economic conference led by Mayor Bloomberg in Belfast, the
dinner we gave at Hillsborough was not restricted to just those in
respective Governments.
In respect of how we handled the issue within the UK, that didn't mean I
invited the Shadow Secretary of State to share every platform, but the
Shadow was not excluded from being at major events. Indeed we made a point
of not only saying we were bi-partisan, but acted accordingly.
Having brokered the Hillsborough Agreement and having discussed with your
Secretary of State - at all stages - how the US could help through an
Economic Conference, I am obviously somewhat disappointed not to have been
invited to attend the Conference in any capacity.
That of course should never be confused with my deep respect and adMiration
for Secretary Clinton. Frankly without her help during her time in the White
House, as a Senator, as a candidate and now as Secretary, we could never
have made the progress we did. You will know that, at the time, I was always
disappointed that her contribution to the peace process and political
process was not recognized appropriately by the Conservative Party and their
spokesmen when they were in Opposition.
The decision by Owen Patterson to decide not to be present at next week's
Conference is a matter for him and the political demands he has chosen on
which to determine his priorities. You would not expect me to comment on his
decision.

However, I don't have to rehearse with you that successful long-term
economic investment in Northern Ireland will require building not only a
stable peace process, but continuing to build cross-party and
cross-community consensus. I am sorry we have not been invited to help.
The current coalition Government in Britain will not always be in power and
it may not even last the course. It seems regrettable that in such a
challenging global economic environment that those of us who helped build
the peace are not even invited to continue helping.

The Secretary's messages at the meeting were outstanding, from OHR's point of view. lnzko is elated - particular with her
firm support for 5+2 and for judicious use of Bonn Powers (BP). Other than from the U.S., and usually from the UK, there
has been, at most, strong reluctance in the Quint to support BP use -- even when there are direct challenges to Dayton

opportunity you gave him to make the pitch directly, he later asked me to convey to you his hope that the Secretary would
be willing to help shore up European support for 5+2 and BP with key PIC colleagues -- especially from Quint countries

Clinton was always vague about what the land on the other side of that bridge was going to look like, and Obama is vague about what

As you know, we are working with Melanne on the upcoming Commission on the Status of Women/February 2011. The
US has been asked to nominate experts to participate in interactive panels during the meeting. Specifically, experts
should focus on the link between women's education and employment, women's participation in science and
technology education and employment, women's access to and use of technology, or gender biases in scientific
knowledge production and product design. We understand that US nominees are often not selected for these panels
given needs to balance regional representations. Still, we should submit one or two names for consideration. Our
suggested nominations would be who could speak to any of the topical areas listed; Dr.
another possibility is who just left

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
Release of Aung San Suu Kyl
Today I join with billions of people around the world to welcome the long-overdue release of Burmese democracy leader
and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest.
Aung San Suu Kyi has endured enormous personal sacrifice in her peaceful struggle to bring democracy and human
rights to Burma, including unjustified detention for most of the past twenty years. The Burmese regime has repeatedly
rejected her offers to engage in dialogue and work together, trying instead to silence and isolate her. Through it all,
Aung San Suu Kyi's commitment to the Burmese people has not wavered.
The United States calls on Burma's leaders to ensure that Aung San Suu Kyi's release is unconditional so that she may
travel, associate with her fellow citizens, express her views, and participate in political activities without restriction. They
should also immediately and unconditionally release all of Burma's 2,100 political prisoners.
We urge Burma's leaders to break from their repressive policies and begin an inclusive dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi
and other democratic and ethnic leaders towards national reconciliation and a more peaceful, prosperous, and
democratic future.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Interesting re; Iran. Coco counsels that Maziar Bahari thinks

s a bit emotional - but admits that for those of us B6Quite an interesting reply to my fanmail to the blogger I've been copying to you.
Hello Coco,Thank you for your kind words and sorry for the late reply -- I've been busy with the holiday season (also why
there's been a drop-off in posts Iately),I wouldn't place an extra emphasis on Haji's arrest (or on anyone at Baran, for
that matter). I think those arrests were geared at intimidating Khatami more than anything. Although he's been more
quiet than either Mousavi or Karoubi, he has ""international clout,"" if you will, so I believe the regime is less willing to
attack him head-on. (Though what we witnessed on Tasooa was admittedly shocking). Actually, with a few exceptions, I
think a threshold has been passed where arrests aren't even strategic anymore. It seems that the vast majority are for
the sake of intimidation. The regime is looking increasingly desperate.Rafsanjani, I'm sure, is up to something. He's a
good ally, but I think the pro-democracy movement should always be wary of his intentions. Ultimately, Rafsanjani is
looking out for Rafsanjani. Having said that, I think his interests and those of the Greens have and will continue to
coalesce. Before the election, this was him funding Mousavi's campaign (in hopes that Mousavi's presidency would bring
him back into the fold after the rise of the ""new right""). Now (and going forward), he's probably more concerned about
his legacy in Iran. We should remember he was the driving force that ascended Khamenei to the Supreme Leadership,
and that there were also accusations that the 2005 election (where he lost to Ahmadinejad) was fixed. Not to simplify
things, but I'm sure there is some resentment. Regardless, sooner or later he's going to have to be more bold and give
the opposition something (namely momentum, as he did with his July sermon) if he wants to get something back (clout,
legacy, etc.).Things are continuing to heat up! God-willing, change will come in 2010. Whether such a change is
ultimately 'regime change' should be up to the Iranian people inside Iran.Best Sent using BlackBerry® from

Below is a message from my friend kevin thanking me for your efforts and alerting
me to the letter that has or will find its way to you from the university president. I forward it to you in case you haven't
seen it, want to get out in front of it, or whatever. The fact that you were instinctively sensitive to this situation should
always be enough but, of course, with this type of loss, it never is. I hope all else is well, there has to be some good news
somewhere. Right? All the best, brianDear Brian,
I wanted to thank you again for
I read with interest today's article in the NY Times on how well the Obama Administration-State Dept is managing the
crisis and associated PR. I know this would be a wonderful opportunity to serve two causes and get some great PR as
well as put the minds of many families at ease if the Sate Department were to make a statement of support for ""leaving
no stone unturned until all Americans lost in Haiti can be returned to their families"". I have already reached out to
Senator Reid as well who had a liaison of his following up on search efforts. You will notice below the University is
making a plea to Secretary Clinton directly, she may or may not be, aware. Again, thank you for your time and if this can
be put in the proper hands it would so be appreciated. You have already done more than I would have expected; and, I
did not want anyone to be surprised if they had not heard of the University and the families making the plea to
Secretary Clinton.

reported killed in any of the attacks. The Israeli strikes targeted a Hamas training camp, where two gunmen
were wounded, smuggling tunnels along Gaza's border with Egypt, and other, unpopulated areas, Hamas

were fired from Gaza into Israel in the past two days. None of the attacks caused any injuries. Hamas leaders

David Cameron will be given the right of reply after the PM's statement this afternoon -- followed by Q&A. UUP MP

The Conservatives are becoming exasperated by the rumors that appear in the press and elsewhere that they are
unsupportive of the agreement. Our contacts say the Tories have been completely consistent in supporting the
government on devolution, though they don't believe HMG handled the issue well (i.e. allowing the exclusion of the UUP

for a 10 minute statement - most believe so he can announce his support for START.
Brown also announced his support for the Treaty this evening. With Alexander, that should put us at the 9 needed

in play (Corker, Chamblis, Cochran, McCain and Murkowski). Moreover, there are bound to be some ""sleepers"" as the

the resurrection of the hospital in just one week. General Keen was key in reestablishing the hospital (and I got to
appreciate MRE's). When we got there there were 1500 patients and 400 corpses in a deserted hospital — our team of 7
was the only group there.... And slowly over the week we have built a functioning hospital again.
Meeting and working with Paul has been good for the soul---- although when I felt I wanted to meet him – this was not
the way...But I think I am in this for the long haul...
Below is an email for President Clinton (it was good to see him and Chelsea and Mark there) I promised to forward this
email by a medical student he spoke to in the operating room .... Desperate to find a way to continue his education.
Attached is picture of him and I in front of the surgery area. And there were 3 more I met a few nights later who had

activity is ready to be presented to the UNSC, a senior Palestinian Authority official said. Saeb Erekat, the chief
Palestinian Authority negotiator in peace talks with Israel, said he expected the resolution would be put to a
UNSC vote in February, after the United States ends its presidency of the council. ""We are not condemning
Israel. We are condemning settlement activities and we hope the resolution will pass,"" Erekat said. He said 15
nations had helped draft the proposal after Palestinian Authority President Abbas requested a UNSC meeting to
discuss settlement building in November. ""Something must be done on the international level to halt the
settlement expansion which the Israeli government is undertaking in the West Bank, including Jerusalem,""
Nabil Abu Rdainah, Abbas's spokesman, said at the time. As the Palestinian Authority has only observer status
at the UN, the resolution will be presented by a full member of the council. Erekat said he hoped the United
States would not use its veto to defeat the resolution and added that if it did not succeed at the UNSC, ""we will
go to the International Court of Justice.""",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

I have a staffer going to Kosovo next weekI'd like to discuss how we do followup. Are you in on Thursday? If so, pis come see me.I thought you'd like to see Vjosa's reaction tp your visit to Kosovo.Dear Melanne,
Thank you; We, group of women leaders met with Secretary Clinton. It was a short meeting, introduction and photo
opportunity. But, I hope the event send a message to our government that women should be supported. I also think
that the Embassy will consider more vision of women of Kosova.
Secretary Clinton was just remarkable. Her message for our, also Belgrade leadership was clear and strait forward;
dialogue, dialogue, dialogue as two independent states!
The admiration expressed by the population in the streets as motorcade was passing, meeting with PM and acting
President, open meeting with students and media was impressive. She is really inspiration for all.
Maybe was not a right time, but I only wish she has pressed the PM on corruption practices.
Thank you once again for facilitating this meeting.
Best regards,
VjosaShe is eager to see you. The embassy told me that they talked to you and you're able to see her.Thanks for replying to the message.
My phone number is
Today someone called me from the US Embassy to invite me to meet Secretary on Wednesday. It is going to be a close
15 min meeting with several women leaders.
Thank you.
VjosaDear Melanne,
Hope this message finds you well.
I am trying to follow your work and every time I run into information that involves you as a speaker or presenter, I know
that strong advocacy for the benefit of women is coming for the future.
I am starting a foundation, with a objective to advocate policies on health, environment and human rights. Women in
the region have serious obstacles to access health care and services, and are suffering from a luck of information. Many
preventable diseases are taking its toll because of the lack of information and facilities, especially regarding breast
cancer and cervical cancer. Also, laws on health care do not require for preventive services such as mammography, pap
smear and other preventive services. I am planning to work on different level, not excluding other target groups but
starting with women.
Today, media have announce the visit of Secretary Hillary Clinton in the region, including Kosovo. Is there any chance to
meet with her during short visit in Prishtina? I know she is coming to assist the dialogue between Prishtina and
Belgrade, but she would be even more helpful if she meets me and other women.
New early elections are coming in few months and she would bust our confidence and would support better
participation of women and better election result.
I am afraid that our government officials are going to meet alone and/or be very selective who can meet her because is
going to have impact on the election.
I am not with any political party but would be wonderful and extremely helpful for the support of woman's agenda Is
any chance that you will be coming with Secretary Clinton?
Best regards,

to the site, and then invited them to walk with her to the press conference. The four Afghan women sat together during

6993,2010-01-30T05:00:00+00:00,"Welcome news. Pls keep me updated w what you hear. Thx.Here's the update, pieced together from various sources:
Starting at around 3 pm Friday, Adams and McGuinness returned to Hillsborogh to meet with Robinson and Arlene
Foster. The four talked privately for several hours and then asked for the draft papers to review. The discussion
continued until around 1 am when the parties left Hillsborough. (Foster's presence is apparently very helpful. Her
relationship with the SF leaders is much more positive and direct, treating them as equal colleagues.)
Woodward and Irish FM Martin will meet with Adams and Robinson separately this afternoon to assess where the talks
are. The talks last night/early morning ended more positively and if that is still the case there may be a decision to push
on today to see if agreement can be reached. It is equally possible that the two ministers and DUP/SF will decide to
wind up today and resume on Monday.
Brown and Cowen have spoken this morning and will speak again late this afternoon.
The issue is still parades. Robinson needs some certainity of change on parades. It is important for him politically within
the DUP, but also externally since this has become a symbol of whether he has achieved something or compromised too
much. Adams and SF have moved very far from their original positions on parades, adding that Robinson has also
moved.
The DUP linkage of the timeframes for devolution and parades is not Robinson's goal but DUP deputy party leader Nigal
Dodds. Logistically, such a linkage would be impossible without delaying devolution given that the parades framework
requires consultation, legislation, and implementation.
The role of Justice Minister and his/her relationship to the Executive has been agreed. Other issues, such as Irish
language act, N-S bodies, etc, while symbolic and emotive for SF and the nationalists community can be dealt with.",jake.sullivan@univ-tlse3.fr

that would extend a freeze on West Bank settlements for 90 days in return for diplomatic and security incentives.
Washington wants Israel to renew a freeze on settlement building in efforts to resume peace talks with Palestinians,
who in September halted negotiations after just a few weeks when Israel refused to extend a 10-month settlement
freeze.
Under the U.S. proposal, if Israel extended the freeze Washington would pledge not to seek further extensions and to
veto any attempts at the United Nations to force a unilateral peace settlement.
U.S. security aid to Israel would also be upgraded.
""I will insist that in any proposal Israel's security needs will be addressed, both in the immediate term and regarding
the threats facing us in the coming decade,"" Netanyahu said in public comments before the cabinet meeting.
The prime minister has previously said any settlement moratorium will not apply to areas around East Jerusalem that
Israel captured during a 1967 war and the Palestinians want as the capital of a future state.
One official in Netanyahu's office said the proposal had ""positive elements"". Israeli political sources said a narrow
majority in Netanyahu's security cabinet, which is ultimately responsible, would likely support accepting the U.S.
proposal.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton shared the plan at a meeting in New York last week, Netanyahu said, adding that
U.S. and Israeli teams were still negotiating a final formula.
A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said there had been no official word regarding a renewed
Israeli freeze on housing starts in the occupied West Bank.
""An official Palestinian commitment will come only after President Abbas hears officially from the American
administration what is going on between them and the Israelis,"" Nabil Abu Rdainah told Reuters.
Palestinian officials in private have expressed anger over U.S. incentives to get Israel to prolong the partial freeze,
saying they were effectively bribing Israel to fulfill basic international obligations.
Israeli officials said Netanyahu, who faces a tough political sell within his own coalition on the settlement issue, had
pushed Clinton for the broad understandings.
Settler leaders, who said acceptance of the proposal would represent ""a fundamental collapse"" of the government's
integrity, called an emergency meeting to discuss the issue.
Under the U.S. plan, Israel would declare a further, three month suspension of construction in the West Bank, land it
captured in a 1967 war where Palestinians seek a state. Any building launched since the original moratorium ended late
in September would be frozen, a diplomatic source said.
Among the pledges offered to Israel by Washington was a guarantee to veto any resolutions brought to the United
Nations Security Council that seek ""to impose a political settlement on Israel,"" the source said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
The United States would also undertake to veto resolutions deemed anti-Israel in the United Nations and other

organized a set of working groups around key initiatives --- women's empowerment; cve; expanded English language
training; cultural programming; youth; climate change; etc so that we can incorporate new proposals into FY2012
budget and re-direct FY 2010 and 2011 funds wherever possible and appropriate. The working groups are being chaired

Chief negotiator says Palestinians will submit request as soon as Bosnia take over Security
Council presidency. 'Israeli government is witnessing an international isolation that it hasn't
witnessed before,' he says
The Palestinians will ask the United Nations Security Council to unilaterally recognize an independent Palestinian
state within the 1967 borders early next month, chief negotiator Saeb Erekat was quoted as saying by the Maan
News Agency Wednesday.
Speaking to reporters in the West Bank town of Jericho, Erekat said the Palestinians are waiting for Bosnia to take
the presidency of the Security Council before submitting the proposal.
""The Israeli government is witnessing an international isolation that it hasn't witnessed before,"" Erekat added. ""And
this is due to the efforts exerted by the Palestinian leadership and by President Mahmoud Abbas.""
According to the report, Erekat expressed hope that the US would not veto the proposal, and also called for South
Korea, Japan, New Zealand and Australia to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state.
Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador and Bolivia have all recognized a Palestinian stare over the past few weeks.
The Palestinians have recently announced their plan to introduce a draft resolution at the UN Security Council
condemning Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
On Friday the London-based Arabic daily Al Hayat quoted Erekat as saying ""the negotiations (with Israel) are over.

Facebook in Syria (even though Facebook is outlawed in Syria it is widely accessed through proxies) showing teachers in
Syria abusing their pupils. Thousands of Syrians made public their support on Facebook (the fact that people made their

fired the teachers.

particularly outrageous. However, we can't ignore the fact that these talk shows are the most watched programming in
prime time.. The report below is fairly typical. The host sets up the discussion in fairly provocative way and the guests,
who come from across the political spectrum, respond. As you can see, the first commentator is strongly anti US.
However, what I have observed since our media offensive began last Fall is that there is usually a more moderate guest
as well, who will argue along the lines that it is only natural for the US to protect its interests and GOP should do a better
job of protecting Pakistan. Believe it or not there have even been instances where we get credit for some of the things
we do. Also on occasion where there have been particularly egregious attacks on US policy, the host will read a

freeze on new settlement construction in the West Bank. However, he made clear that Israel would have to cease all
settlement activities if the direct negotiations with Israel are to succeed. ""Israel must choose between peace and the

donePls print for me.I attended the Foreign Policy Initiative meeting this morning with Senator McCain as a speaker and he reiterated these
two stumbling blocks for New STARR 1. Modernization and 2. Missile defense. Sounded very much like talking points.
With missile defense he stated that ""he was very disturbed by the signing agreement with Russia"" that linked New
START with missile defense. He said he wanted to see a very strong statement that makes a clear distinction between
New START and missile defense. In terms of modernization he's taking his cues from Sen. Kyl who he thinks is making
good strides in agreements with the Administration. He said that he thinks both these issues can be resolved and the
Senate can vote on New START — he said that he thinks some Republicans are going to push that the senate only
consider and CR and the extension of the tax cuts.
He also said that he thinks it's a good idea to reduce nuclear weapons, but anyone who says that it will affect other
nation's (i.e. Iran and North Korea) nuclear ambitions are ridiculous. Someone asked if he supports President Obama's
vision of a nuclear weapons free world — he stated ""I hope that we have a world without nuclear weapons one day, but I
also hope pigs fly — and I think neither will happen very soon.""
He did mention that he is worried about the rise of the isolationist wing of the Republicans Party and the decline of the
internationalist wing. He stated that ""he was worried about the erosion of support within the Republican Party for the
Afghanistan War.""<http://thehill.com/>",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

23 after a patrol came under fire by Taliban insurgents, but foreign troops said the circumstances were unclear.
A statement released by the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said two civilians had possibly
been killed in the Maidan Shahr district of Wardak province, west of Kabul, when insurgents attacked the patrol.
""During the attack, three Afghan citizens on a motorcycle entered the engagement area. Two of them fell off the
vehicle and were taken away by local villagers,"" ISAF said.
It said their condition could not be determined before they were taken away. The incident was under investigation,
ISAF said.
However, a spokesman for the Wardak governor said ISAF troops had fired indiscriminately and killed two students
about 30 miles west of Kabul when a rocket was fired at their convoy. He said the rocket was apparently fired by the
Taliban.
Wardak police chief Nawas Haqyar said ISAF troops were returning fire and mistakenly killed the students. The attack
prompted a brief demonstration by angry villagers, demanding an explanation from NATO forces over the killing.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Thank you so much for making the time to address the reception celebrating the passage of the Defense Trade
Cooperation Treaties with the UK and Australia. Everyone in the room put forward tremendous effort towards achieving
the treaties passage and they appreciated the recognition of their efforts that you provided.
I'm working on a memo to you that will summarize PM's achievements during the first 18 months of my tenure as well
as the Bureau's priorities going forward. Once I send it up to you, I'll work with Eric, Jake, Cheryl, etc. on setting up a
time with you to discuss to ensure that we are capturing your priorities.
Thanks again.

A statement released October 23 by Prime Minister Nouni al-Maliki's office said the timing of the documents' release
raises questions about whether it was motivated by politics.
The statement said the documents show no proof of any improper treatment of detainees while al-Maliki has been at

May 9, 2010. Re: Sunday, State of Play
Clegg is still in talks with Cameron. About 1,500 Liberal Democrats spontaneously protested at Lib-Dem headquarters
against a deal with the Tories given their policies, especially on Europe. But Clegg remains in negotiations. He seems
quite intent on working it out with Cameron, it appears. His inner Tory magnetically draws him to his heritage. Clegg has
also misplayed almost every turn, presented with big chances and blowing them through a combination of inexperience
(derived partly from heading a party out of power for nearly 100 years) and inbred arrogance (from no less a privileged
background than Cameron, though seeming less snobbish because he went to Westminster instead of Eton and has a
less pronounced upper-class accent, more neutral, because of his more cosmopolitan roots through his family).
What about Labour? Shaun and a couple of others have rounded up about 29 votes from other parties (Scottish National
Party, NI parties, Welsh party) that could be part of a grand progressive once-in-a-lifetime coalition that required the
LDs. Gordon has said he will allow Clegg-Cameron discussions to play out and a general offer to Clegg is on the table, its
terms giving far more on a referendum and policy than the Tories. Behind the scenes, Labour is putting whatever harsh
pressure it can on LD leaders. Peter is playing a cynical double game. He is a sectarian in a sect of one. Yet Gordon for
strange psychological reasons rooted in his triangle with Tony and Peter relies on Peter. Peter, according to Shaun, has
wrung a pledge from Borwn that if Brown emerges from this crisis he, Peter, will replace David as Foreign Secretary.
Meanwhile, Peter has advised David to sideline himself. David has done so instead of being forward as a strong party
man behind Brown in dire straits. Standing back only makes David look ambitious, waiting for Brown to lose and aiming",sidney.blumenthal@univ-tlse3.fr

Is the Vitamin A research on p. 8 accurate given recent research that raised doubts about it efficacy?
Will you print out a copy of the MDGs for me to have for speech?
Is there a teleprompter?
Didn't Jim Grant also pioneer the widespread use of oral rehydration therapy? If so, we should include too.
It is so much better--thank you.To more fully answer your question, the CARE speech is important because it focuses on a chronically overlooked issue
(nutrition) that sits at the intersection of two of your signature issues. It gives us an opportunity to sharpen our

BY VALERIE M. HUDSON, PATRICIA LEIDL I MAY 10, 2010
One day in November 2009, in Helmand province's capital of Lashkar Gah, a group of Afghan widows and divorcees met
with Patricia, who had been commissioned to write a series of success stories for the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID). All the women were in their 20s, 30s, and 40s but looked to be in their 60s. Until very recently,
none of them could work because they possessed no marketable skills, could neither read nor write, and were at risk of
being killed if they left their homes. A number of women said that, before the program -- which focused on tailoring and
basic literacy -- their children used to weep at night from hunger.",lauren.jiloty@univ-tlse3.fr

The Security Council deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force during the Israeli military
operation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza. The Council, in this context, condemns those acts
which resulted in the loss of at least ten civilians and many wounded, and expresses its condolences to their
families. The Security Council requests the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel. The
Council urges Israel to permit full consular access, to allow the countries concerned to retrieve their deceased and
wounded immediately, and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance from the convoy to its destination. The
Security Council takes note of the statement of the UN Secretary—General on the need to have a full investigation into
the matter and it calls for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforminglo international
standards. The Security Council stresses that the situation in Gaza is not sustainable. The Council re-emphasizes the
importance of the full implementation of Resolutions 1850 and 1860. In that context, it reiterates its grave concern at
the humanitarian situation in Gaza and stresses the need for sustained and regular flow of goods and people to Gaza as
well as unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. The Security Council
underscores that the only viable solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement negotiated between the parties
and re-emphasizes that only a two-State solution, with an independent and viable Palestinian State living side by side in
peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours, could bring peace to the region. The Security Council expresses
support for the proximity talks and voices concern that this incident took place while the proximity talks are underway
and urges the parties to act with restraint, avoiding any unilateral and provocative actions, and all international partners
to promote an atmosphere of cooperation between the parties and throughout the region.",huma.abedin@univ-tlse3.fr

Statement by the Secretary
The Death of Polish President Kaczynski and His Delegation
I join President Obama in offering my deepest condolences to the people of Poland, to the Kaczynski family, and to the
families of all those killed in this tragedy. Lost alongside President Kaczynski and his wife were Polish leaders from
across the political spectrum, men and women who shaped and sped Poland's post-1989 democratic transformation and
were leading Poland into its promising future. The tragedy of these lives cut short will be felt deeply across the world,
but their legacy will live on in a free and flourishing Poland.
The United States stands with the Polish people in this difficult hour. Like the country he led, President Kaczynski was
one of America's most valued and trusted allies. He was well known in the United States as a champion for democracy
against an oppressive regime, a man whose journey took him from the Gdarisk Shipyards to the presidency of a free
people. President Kaczynski was an unstinting advocate for freedom and human rights not just in Poland, but around
the world. He will be long remembered and sorely missed.
The Polish people have endured more than their share of sorrow, but they have always shown resilience and resolve in
the face of adversity -- and I know they will pull together in solidarity to grieve this loss.
My thoughts and prayers are with all the people of Poland today.",huma.abedin@univ-tlse3.fr

May 13, 2010Re: Hague meeting
On your meeting on Friday, May 14, with new British Foreign Secretary William Hague you might explore a number of
issues below. (I've discussed with Shaun.)
1. Northern Ireland. Cameron has pledged to reduce public sector spending in NI. But the impact of public sector
spending there is not the same as in other parts of the UK because of 40 years of troubles. Political stability depends
upon economic stability. Removing funding specifically threatens community policing, creating a vacuum that the Real
IRA and other men of violence would rush into. Cutting the public sector would make it difficult to increase private
sector investment. Does the new government understand the US interest in NI and appreciate the fragility of the
situation?
2. Defense and Foreign Policy Cuts. The new government program is to slash the deficit, cutting deeply into
government programs. This really cannot be done without defense and foreign policy reductions. Seek claficiation on
exactly whether and where these cuts be made. Will they affect Afghanistan policy and over what schedule? How will
cuts in the foreign service affect British influence in other areas?
3. Trident and Nuclear Deterrent. The coalition agreement between the Conservative and Liberal Democrats allows",lauren.jiloty@univ-tlse3.fr

respect for you was much in evidence on all levels. Most of the cabinet turned out for the reception that the amb hosted
for me. The FM went out his way to tell me what it meant to get a call from you when he assumed his position (he's
hoping to have a few mins with you in Tallin). As far as Lith has to go, it has achieved some remarkable achievements for
Eastern Eur. They have a female president, Speaker, Finance minister and def. minister. I had a good meeting with the
President and thanked her for Lith commitment to our collective efforts in afghanistan. They run the smallest PRT and,
despite a tough economy, have done everything we've asked in terms of additional support since the surge. The meeting
with the Speaker and top women members of the parl'nt was yet another reminder of your inspiration over many years.
One of the women was at the Vienna VV conf and said she's in politics today because of you. Another read about safe
birthing kits in your book and was inspired to send several thousand to Afghanistan. They are eager for more
opportunities to work together.
I came primarily to launch the new working group on gender that we and Lith are co-chairing. There was much gratitude
for our leadership with them in the Community of Democracies.
The meaning of democracy is so strong for people who had to stuggle for it more recently. They really feel this is an
important time to renew the understanding of democ, particularly after the bruising it underwent over the last several
years.
We had terrific turnout from other countries, many comments about you and references to Beijing and Iceland VV conf.
(So many people told me the impact Vienna and Iceland had on them). We left our meeting with many commitments for
future concrete projects that will be undertaken. There is great hope that you will be in Krakow in July for the CD
ministerial. The Lith CD coordinator headed to Belgium the next day for an EU meeting. He told me he got a very positive
response for our gender initiative and that Ashton was particularly excited about it. The EU is locating their new gender
institute in Lithuania and they are ager for our help.
The Dutch minister who came
said the outcome of their election in June will say much about the nature of their ongoing commitment in Afg.
Lastly, I arrived shortly after the Polish tragedy. There is a very close relationship between the 2 countries and their grief
was palpable. Jolenta Kwasniewska and several other Poles came to the CD meeting. She told me that they lost so many
of their top leaders across all sectors of society, incl several top women leaders. Jolenta' foundation has been very active
in advancing women's progress in Poland as well as working in other countries.",lauren.jiloty@univ-tlse3.fr

deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Dr. Dorothy. Height, an icon of America's long march toward equality and a
personal inspiration to us both. As the only woman among the ""Big Six"" civil rights leaders, Dr. Height helped galvanize a
movement that changed our country forever. She organized the ""Wednesdays in Mississippi"" meetings that brought
black and white women together to find common ground and break down barriers. She never stopped fighting for what
she knew was right. And through it all, she was always the best dressed woman in the room. We were blessed to know
Dr. Height, to benefit from her grace, passion and wisdom, and to call her our friend. For decades, starting with the early
days at the Children's Defense Fund, we worked with her, learned from her, and drew inspiration from her example.
From the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to the Congressional Gold Medal, to the unveiling of a long-sought-after bust
of Sojourner Truth in the United States Capitol, we had the privilege of helping honor Dr. Height and her
accomplishments. Born before women had the right to vote, denied access to the college of her choice because of the
color of her skin, and witness to nation divided, Dr. Height dedicated her life to the proposition that all Americans should
have the opportunity to live up to their full God-given potential. Our nation is poorer for her loss but infinitely richer for
the life she led, the progress she achieved, and the people she touched. Our thoughts and prayers are with Dr. Height's
family today, and with her many loving friends and colleagues. She would be the first to tell us that the best way to
honor her memory is to carry forward the work she started and the causes she championed, to open wide the freedom
gates. May we all find the strength and the wisdom to live up to her legacy.",huma.abedin@univ-tlse3.fr

Murders in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico
Today the men and women of the Department of State are mourning the murder of three people connected to the
United States Consulate General in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. One American consulate employee was killed along with her
husband, and the husband of a Mexican employee was also killed. I offer my deepest sympathies to the family, loved
ones and colleagues of these victims. The safety and security of our personnel and their families in Mexico and at posts
around the world is always our highest priority. I have spoken with our Ambassador in Mexico and we are working with
the Government of Mexico to do everything necessary to protect our people and to ensure that the perpetrators of
these horrendous acts are brought to justice.
These appalling assaults on members of our own State Department family are, sadly, part of a growing tragedy besetting
many communities in Mexico. They underscore the imperative of our continued commitment to work closely with the
Government of President CalderOn to cripple the influence of trafficking organizations at work in Mexico. This is a

and common interest bind the Mexican and the American people closely together.",jake.sullivan@univ-tlse3.fr

Local media drew attention this weekend to the line in the introduction of our annual human rights report that
refers to the GOH by saying that there is severe corruption in all branches of government. called this B6
morning asking for a copy of the report (which we sent him), saying that the President was upset and wanted to read it.
The Embassy human rights officer sent the Department a first draft of this report late last year. It normally would have
gone through two or three more versions with input from DRL and ultimately clearance by the Embassy Front Office.
Because our Human Rights officer (Kathey-Lee Galvin) was seriously injured in the quake, DRL took it upon themselves to
finish the report. The final draft was never sent to us for clearance/comments and I don't know who all in the
Department cleared off on it. You may already be familiar with the report, but in the event you are not, I wanted you to
have a copy in advance of meetings in Santo Domingo where you may hear about it from Cheers, B6

jmUnder Secretary McHale:
This week we have seen the most extraordinary series of public attacks on the United States by Lt Gen (ret) Hamid Gul, a
noted anti-American crackpot who derives his role as an ""expert analyst"" by being the only former Inter-Services
Intelligence (151) Chief who ever appears on TV. Gul was briefly ISI chief during PM Bhutto's first term in office almost 20
years ago. Appearing on several TV stations this week, Gul has repeated allegations that the U.S. is implicated in the
Bhutto Assassination — the subject is current this week because of the release of the U.N. report on the assassination,
which is itself a remarkable document.
One ironic element of the UN report on the assassination is the report that on October 16, 2007 former PM Bhutto
wrote to General Musharraf that the very same Hamid Gul was one of three people she considered a threat to her
security. (see excerpt below) This fact came up in none of the programs.
Our view is that the television journalists and executives now must begin taking responsibility for putting inciting and
unsubstantiated claims on the air. We have released the attached ""Correction,"" which will be seen by news editors
across the country.

In my last email (Friday, 5/28), I attached the letter from the bipartisan Co-Chairs and Executive Committee members of
the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission sent to Assistant Secretary Mike Posner expressing grave concern about the
recent rise in death threats, attacks and murders of Colombian human rights defenders, religious, community and other
NGO leaders. Congressman McGovern also strongly encouraged the Secretary to meet with representatives of those
organizations and individuals being threatened, with a particularly effort to reach out to and invite the Bishops of
Tumaco (Narifio), Barrancabermeja/Medio Magdalena (Santander), and we would now add Putumayo, since the
Colombian Catholic Church just advised us yesterday of increased death threats against religious workers there. In
addition, we recommended inviting Monserior Hector Fabio Henao, director of Pastoral Social, at the Archdiocese in
Bogota, who represents all the pastoral work of the Church throughout the country, as well as representatives from the
Mennonite and Lutheran churches, in particular.
While in Colombia, the most important thing the Secretary can do is avoid effusive praise for President Alvaro Uribe,
who leaves office in August. Inside Colombia, the visit by the Secretary is being described as focusing solely on the free
trade agreement and continuing support of the counterdrug strategy/Plan Colombia. Without changes in the human
rights situation and the culture of impunity, it is unlikely that anything the Secretary might say or do will alter the
equation on Capitol Hill regarding the trade agreement. It should be noted that the October 2008 GAO report on the
counter-drug operations in Colombia concluded that U.S. assistance was successful in increasing security in parts of the

Obama Backs Down on Sudan
By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF
JUBA, Sudan
Until he reached the White House, Barack Obama repeatedly insisted that the United States apply more pressure on
Sudan so as to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe in Darfur and elsewhere.
Yet, as president, Mr. Obama and his aides have caved, leaving Sudan gloating at American weakness. Western
monitors, Sudanese journalists and local civil society groups have all found this month's Sudanese elections to be deeply
flawed - yet Mr. Obama's special envoy for Sudan, Maj. Gen. Scott Gration, pre-emptively defended the elections, saying
they would be ""as free and as fair as possible."" The White House showed only a hint more backbone with a hurried
reference this week to ""an essential step"" with ""serious irregularities.""
President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan - the man wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against
humanity in Darfur - has been celebrating. His regime calls itself the National Congress Party, or N.C.P., and he was",cheryl.mills@univ-tlse3.fr

Dear Cheryl —
It's our understanding that the review of the terrorist list undertaken at the beginning of the year is reaching
completion, imminently. Jim asked me to shoot you a note that this continues to be a very important issue for him and
Bill Delahunt. The list needs to be purged of political manipulation — and quite frankly, the current status quo with Cuba
needs to be broken, not further reinforced — for the sake of Alan Gross, those on the island needing space to voice their
views, and indeed, all of us outside who know change is coming.
It's time to do something bold and constructive — and in our very best interests —
Let us know if there's anything we can do to help —

Dear Cheryl --
Attached please find a letter regarding the review of terrorist lists currently taking place within the Obama
Administration. The letter cites Cuba as a nation that should be purged from such lists, including the State Sponsors of
Terrorism list, as an example for the need of a thorough, robust and judicious review and updating of these lists.
Can you please ensure that the Secretary and other relevant State Department officials are made aware of this letter?
Very best regards --

Haiti recovery blueprint includes foreign donors
BY JACQUELINE CHARLES
jcharles@MiamiHerald.com
Call it the $100 million club.
That's the amount each donor nation will have to ante up for a say in Haiti's early recovery under a plan Haitian
President Rene Preval plans to present at an international donors conference in New York at month's end.
While Haitian and foreign disaster experts were tallying the cost to rebuild after the Jan. 12, 7.0-magnitude earthquake -
- $11.5 billion -- Preval and his advisors have been quietly negotiating the blueprint of the development plan that will
shape Haiti's reconstruction over the next decade.
""It moves it in the right direction,"" Mark Schneider, senior vice president of the Washington D.C.-based International
Crisis Group, said of the plan, which he has seen. ""I've said, the first phase of reconstruction is a decade. The real test is
a generation and hopefully with partnerships both inside and outside of Haiti, it will continue for that time period.""",cheryl.mills@univ-tlse3.fr

202-647-7209The principle conclusion from a quick visit to Israel and Ramallah over the weekend is that Netanyahu is in a strong
position politically, with an unusually stable ruling coalition. Nobody I spoke with believed that the government would
have fallen if he had decided to extend the settlement freeze before its expiry, as a gesture to U.S. peacemaking efforts.
In their view, he could have easily garnered the support of a large majority of the people, for whom the settlers are a
marginal concern. And this would have given him leverage over his ministers to ensure their support or abstention in
the cabinet. As Dan Meridor noted, Likud voters are to the left of their Knesset members when it comes to peacemaking
(70 percent support the two-state solution, vs only 50 percent of the leadership).
Lieberman, not the Likud, is Bibi's chief concern. He wants to keep him in the government for as long as possible for fear
that when he leaves he will garner the support of those on the right, including from the Likud, who oppose
peacemaking. For the time being, Bibi uses the threat of an alternative coalition with Kadima to keep Lieberman in the
tent. But the clock is ticking. According to Tzipi Livni, she can bring her party into the government now, and is willing to
do so without any demand for ""rotation,"" provided Bibi is serious about negotiating peace. But as the elections grow
closer, more and more of her party members are turning against the idea of joining the government. They are
strengthened in their views by recent internal polling which shows Kadima with 32 seats (up from 28 now), Likud slightly
down at 25, and Labor at only 5.
Therefore, if Bibi intends to make a deal with Abu Mazen, he will need to do so sooner rather than later. The longer he
waits, the less leverage he has on Lieberman and the more likely Lieberman will break away to oppose him in the next
elections.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

Preval rejects US advice on presidential election
By JONATHAN M. KATZ (AP) — 2 hours ago
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Haiti's president on Wednesday rejected U.S. Senate recommendations on holding an election
for his successor, brushing off criticism that the current process will leave the shattered country without a credible
leader.
A report issued this month by Sen. Richard Lugar, the ranking Republican on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, ""strongly encourages"" Haiti to let its international partners help restructure the eight-member Provisional
Electoral Council, which has been accused of corruption.
The report also recommends ensuring the participation of the key opposition party of ousted former President Jean-
Bertrand Aristide, which was blocked from participating in 2009 legislative contests because of a dispute over rival
candidate lists.
On Tuesday, President Rene Preval fulfilled one recommendation of the report by issuing a signed decree setting
election day for Nov. 28.
But speaking at a news conference in an open-air gazebo alongside the broken remains of the national palace a day
later, Preval told reporters he had no intention of complying with the rest, including changing the election body, known
as the CEP.
""I'm not doing the CEP with international partners. I'm doing the CEP with national partners,"" Preval said. ""The senator's
proposition is inadmissible.""
Seeking to show the council was not ""hand-picked,"" as he said in English, Preval handed out copies of nomination letters
for the panel's members submitted by various national and religious organizations, including the National Council of
Political Parties, Roman Catholic Church and National Confederation of Haitian Vodou.",cheryl.mills@univ-tlse3.fr millscdstate.gov.@univ-tlse3.fr

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
Bombing of the Shrine of Syed Ali Hujviri in Lahore
I was shocked and saddened by yesterday's attack on one of Pakistan's most popular places of worship, the Shrine of
Syed Ali Hujviri (Data Ganjbakhsh) in Lahore, which claimed the lives of many innocent Pakistanis.
The extremists have shown that they respect neither human dignity nor the fundamental religious values of Pakistani
society. Violating the sanctity of this revered shrine is a particularly sinister attempt to destabilize Pakistan and to
intimidate its people. The attackers will not succeed, as the Pakistani public refuses to be cowed by such violence.
We condemn this brutal crime and reaffirm our commitment to support the Pakistani people in their efforts to defend
their democracy from the violent extremists who seek to destroy it. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of
the victims and with all the people of Pakistan.",jake.sullivan@univ-tlse3.fr

the countryside, aid workers said. Some of the roughly 300 students and other protesters said they feared the Doctors

the week-old epidemic that has killed 284 people and infected 3,769, according to United Nations figures. Witnesses
said the protesters threw rocks and at least one Molotov cocktail. UN peacekeepers from Argentina arrived with riot
shields to reinforce police. Warning shots were heard; the UN said its soldiers fired blanks. There were no reports of
injuries. Haitian health officials assured the crowd the clinic would not open in that neighborhood. The 400-bed facility
was intended to rehydrate and treat people with the severe diarrheal disease. Doctors Without Borders-Spain country

Have a good trip.This is terrific Melanne and many thanks. KurtI just wanted to give you some background on the initiatives that New Zealand and Australia have put together to
empower women in the Pacific region and which they would like to spotlight during the Secretary's trip.
NZ wants to announce a collaboration between us and their government to increase women's political participation in
the Pacific region. Their development agency has made this a priority for the Secretary's trip. Our hope is that S will
welcome the collaboration in her remarks at a business leaders, et al reception.
Australia wants to announce a collaboration with us on an initiative to combat violence against women in the region. I
don't know where this will be included in S's remarks, but I hope it will. Both governments are committing significant
resources; we are committing much less, but Australia and NZ are eager to partner with us to address challenges in the
Pacific region.
I wanted to briefly share some thoughts on this formed during my last trip to China. It made the collaboration with NZ
and Australia on deeper engagement with the Pacific Islands on women and development issues that much more
compelling.
I was in Shanghai and Beijing last month to speak at the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) international women's

I just wanted to give a quick update on the productive meeting we had with President Preval and his team of advisers
yesterday, including Gabriel Verret, to discuss a number of critical issues to move the project in the North forward.
The GOH has identified site 15 as the preferred site with which to move forward. This decision is based on the incoming
analysis from the IDB on flood risk & drainage, as well as soil and water studies. These studies point to better soil quality
and drainage on site 15 as compared to 14. Importantly, the analysis did not point to any flood risks.
The site decision enables the IDB to immediately move forward with the in depth environmental and social analysis,
which includes a water systems assessment to shed further light on quantities and quality available. President Preval
Identified site 14 as the back-up site should the assessments point to any unforeseen risks to the development of a
viable park in this location.
I think it makes sense to undertake a call on early Tuesday morning to review the status of the project, address
outstanding issues, and get an update on this week's conference. I have again attached the overall timeline of the
project and note that a number of deliverables are lagging and require greater attention to meet the agreed target of
beginning construction in January 2011.
I would suggest a call at 7am Tuesday morning given our multiple time zones. I have copied Joanne and would be
grateful if you could RSVP as to the availability of the appropriate representatives from your team to participate at this
time. Thanks so much.

AMDear Hillary and Anne-Marie,
For several months I've been advising on a project to take the rainforest restoration work of Dr. Willie Smits, an
Indonesian agroforester, to scale on Borneo. That Smits Model effort now has an economically sustainable design with
multiple benefits for the local forest population, the nation of Indonesia, and the planet. The business plan has been
developed by an experienced and highly reputable investment group that serves in an Advisory role to the Prince of
Wales's Trust, and the business plan has already engaged the interest of the P8, a group of the eight largest global
pension funds.
The core goals of the Arenga Reforestation Project include greenhouse gas reduction, habitat restoration, rainforest
remediation, deforestation protection, biofuel production that is non-food and carbon-positive, and poverty alleviation
for some of the most vulnerable populations on the planet. The Internal Rate of Return, on a fairly mature business
model and seven years of module testing, calculates to about 34% -- a decent investment return for almost any industry.",anne-marie.slaughter@univ-tlse3.fr

aimed at figuring out where we could do better and above all create more leverage to achieve our goals. The papers are
blunter than anything you would see from the bureaus -- they should not necessarily be read as policy blueprints but
rather as illustrations of alternative strategies. We have made sure that the special assistants have them on the plane. I

Background for youMy comments in text below — need to talk to you — if you get this and can talk — call me through ops — I am still in office.
cdmCheryl:
I know you are busy but I wanted to close the loop with you on the ED position (Lois Quam), the chair position for
Operations Committee, and the need to ensure that there is specific language in the QDDR that keeps PEPFAR in the
State Department (one or two sentences). I believe it is in all our interests to do this. [AGREE] I also wanted to discuss
with you the process to determine the benchmarks. [I WISH WE COULD GET THEM IN QDDR SO THERE IS FIRMNESS
AND CLARITY— WORRIED IF WE DO IT LATER IT WILL BE A NEGOTIATION AND SQUISHY]; Raj is hesitant to concretize,
plus I know he is very busy. We are going to deliver to him today a version that has been agreed on by CDC and OGAC. I
will propose a process that would include a public vetting of the benchmarks but do not think the benchmarks need to
be specifically defined in the QDDR. [FINE BUT SEE ABOVE — CAN I SEE DRAFT AS IS?] The reference to the Operations
Committee and the Secretary as the trigger for movement into USAID is enough.
I have been made aware of a growing discussion on the Hill around GHI as an attempt by the Administration to diminish
the PEPFAR program contributions because of its association with President Bush. Last night's prime time FOX news
piece (>10 minutes) on PEPFAR was well done. President Bush was clear about why he started PEPFAR and why he feels
it is still the right thing to do and to continue (Humanitarian/Security both addressed). He also spoke directly to the
bipartisan nature of the program (from inception) and the need to continue bipartisan support. It was a missed
opportunity not to have had President Obama on the FOX piece to make the point that ""GNI is building on PEPFAR...""
and to begin a bipartisan dialogue. (WH declined as I understand it) [WE SHOULD MAKE THIS POINT — S ALWAYS CREDITS
BUSH ON THIS B/C HE EARNED IT— WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT'S PART OF OUR NARRATIVE — I BELIEVE IT CAN BE
DROPPED IN QDDR DRAFT TO THAT EFFECT — CAN YOU WORK WITH DANA TO MAKE SURE THAT LANGUAGE GETS IN BY
SUNDAY?]",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

American Diplomacy Revealed -- as Good
By ROGER COH.E,N
NEW YORK-- Let's hear it for the men and women of the U.S. Foreign Service!
They are, to judge from the WikiteakS dump of a 'quarter-million of their private or secret
cables, thoughtful, well-informed and dedicated servants of the American interest who write
clear, declarative English sentences.
I've not heard much in the torrent of Wiki-c.hatter about these admirable career diplomats whose
diplomacy is now condemned to be unquiet. Yet it is they whose byes have been upturned. Every
journalist knows that if their correspondence over several years was suddenly made public, they
would lose most of their sources. That should give every journalist pause.
So it will be on the front line of U.S. diplomacy. Contacts will self-censor. They will go quiet,
particularly in the more conspiratorial parts of the world which also tend to be the most unstable,",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

CdmMills, Cheryl D; Lindwall, David E; Merten, Kenneth H; B61
As Haiti enters the period of electoral contestation, it is essential that all political actors remain
calm and encourage their supporters to do the same. The United States, together with Haiti's
international community partners, stands ready to support efforts to thoroughly review irregularities
in support of electoral results that are consistent with the will of the Haitian people expressed in
their votes.
Like others, the Government of the United States is concerned by the Provisional Electoral
Council's announcement of results from the November 28 national elections that are inconsistent
with the published results of the National Election Observation Council (CNO), which had more
than 5,500 observers and observed the vote count in 1,600 voting centers nationwide, election-day
observations by official U.S. observers accredited by the CEP, and vote counts observed around the
country by numerous domestic and international observers.
Haiti's transition to democracy over the past 24 years has seen many successes, overcoming major
challenges. The 2010 elections represent a critical test of whether the Haitian people will
determine their destiny through their vote. The United States is committed to the consolidation of
democracy in Haiti and calls on the Government of Haiti, the CEP and all political forces to ensure
that the will of the people is fully reflected in the outcome of this election.

board members and some military leadership, but if she is to only get one bite of the apple with HRC her
recommendation is to ""do it right"" and move this to January (either the week of the 10th or 241. The idea in January
would be to include members of congress and frame the event as the QDDR making the case for State/USAID's mission
and resources in the new environment. We could take the event in a number of directions (Liz would LOVE to get Gates
together with Clinton) but the idea to launch the QDDR in January with USGLC as the blueprint for supporting
international affairs and the 150 account.

FyiSenator DeMint is insisting that he and Sujay sit down to personally review her post-hearing QFR answers. This is highly
unusual. We offered Sujay up right away, but DeMint's staff insisted that the Senator was only available to meet on
December 16 (the Senate target adjournment date is December 17). This effectively scuttles any chance Sujay has of
getting confirmed this Congress.
Unfortunately, we don't have much recourse. Sujay's nomination will remain on Tuesday's business meeting agenda, but
given his request, DeMint will exercise his prerogative and ask that she be held over. With no other business meetings
scheduled this year, she'll remain stuck in Committee.
There's another factor at play here too. We learned yesterday afternoon that Sujay has taken it upon herself to reach out
to different Senator's offices. I don't know what exactly she's been saying, but the leg officer (a State Department fellow)
handling Sujay's nomination got an email from Hatch's office. He has been supportive of her and we have a good working
relationship with them. I don't know what Sujay said, but the message back from Hatch's person is that ""while we do
support her, this really makes us question her common sense and judgment."" We obviously told her to stop her outreach
campaign.
Finally, Hatch's office also informed us that Brownback is rumored to be considering a hold on Sujay's nomination if
DeMint for any reason relents.What is the state of play?CherylScheduled for next Thursday at 1:45pm. It is a staff-only meeting.

Last night, as I was unlocking my bike on a windswept Greenwich Village sidewalk after leaving a holiday party, a friend
approached, cell phone in hand. A few minutes earlier, she and I had been inside, chatting happily amid the buzz and warmth of
a holiday party. Now she had tears in her eyes. ""Richard Holbrooke died,"" she said.
Notwithstanding the hospital bulletins since he fell ill on Saturday—critical condition, damaged aorta, emergency surgery—this

Cancun. Way beyond any expectations. Many challenges ahead, but a very good day for us and a great day for Mexico.
Have a very happy holiday if I don't see you before. Best, Todd",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr

omnibus appropriations bill. Instead, he filed cloture motions on the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell and the DREAM
Act.
Those petitions will ripen on Saturday. So it looks like the Senate will be again considering the new START Treaty
tomorrow. We should know the starting time shortly.",hillary.clinton@univ-tlse3.fr
